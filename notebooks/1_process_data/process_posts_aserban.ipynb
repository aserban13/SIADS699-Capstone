       "      <td>EDIT: there is an extreme lack of transparency. Refusal to answer direct and deliberate questions. Constant mistakes in the loan disclosures. Just a huge general incompetence that is honestly beyond embarrassing and beyond frustrating being that it’s one of the biggest purchases I’ll probably ever make it my life. Unwillingness to admit fault and fix the errors always pointing blame and shifting the conversation. Truly worst experience I could have imagine working with them. My LO is a joke. \\n\\n\\nI’m going through an absolute nightmare experience with them right now. They did a complete bait and switch on me. literally tripling my estimated closing cost. I feel like they purposely took their time with the appraisal EDIT** (took them 18** days!!!) now that I see the pictures in his report we’re from much earlier than I thought. \\n\\nNow leaving me only nine days till closing and are demanding a whole laundry list of repairs to be done that are not only extremely expensive added up, but most being purely cosmetic (repaint the house and fix some pieces of wood siding and trim) AND I have a conventional loan. The audacity blows my fucking mind. Even if every lender would require the same repairs, the fact that they are not even willing to, except a letter of intent is wrong. I’m being forced to extend my closing date or breach the contract. Which is more money. \\n\\nPlus the loan officer lied to me blatantly lied to me about the closing cost because she knew I plan to go with another lender. I am a first time homebuyer with virtually zero prior experience. Just trying to do research and learn as I go and trust referrals and it bit me in my ass. I did not get the real closing numbers until I had already gave her the $500 good faith deposit which by the way does not go towards anything and it’s money you will never get back. By the way, I asked several times for a formal loan estimate document and it literally took weeks before I got it. She would always confirm things over the phone or through text now I know that’s part of their scam. \\n\\nShe verified with me over the phone 100 times what my closing cost were which evidently was just a blatant lie. Every time I confront her she disappears. The company will not get me in touch with the manager. Nobody there says they can help me. So basically had me convinced that my total costs to close was just the cost of a rate buy down thanks to my seller concessions. She made it very clear. But it was a blatant lie. \\n\\nIt’s already too late to go with another lender because I will not be able to close on time and will have to incur many fees for extending my closing date, and or possibly just breach the contract and risk the extensive cost of that. \\n\\nI don’t even know what to do anymore. Just making this post to warn the people looking at lenders to not take your chances with them.\\n\\nAlso, according to their site, I should qualify for certain lender credits, but they did not honor it. They’re rates were higher than others, but I stayed with them due to this loan program that ended up costs more than it was saving.\\n\\nThe sales woman / LO is very nice on the phone but ultimately misleading so don’t fall for it like I did :)\\n\\nAlso if you try to get in touch with a manger there GOODLUCK. You never will.\\n\\nPS: if it’s not obvious already, I’m just having fun now in the comments and blowing off steam. Don’t take it personal!</td>\n",

       "      <td>As a first time home buyer and a first generation home buyer, I was absolutely lost when it came to the purchase of my first home. Like many other clueless individuals, I turned to google to begin my mortgage lender search. Of course, from the first moment I searched the web, rocket mortgage has flooded me with targeted ads. So, I caved and went through their pre approval. \\n\\nPre approval was extremely easy. Just a few pieces of basic info and I was approved. Tummy approval was MUCH higher than I anticipated though, so I kept this in mind. When it finally came time to make an offer, the home I secured was $50k lower than my pre approval amount. After a back and forth with my lender they said it was a “tight squeeze” but I could make that amount work. So, that was red flag #1 but, nevertheless, it worked out in my favor. \\n\\nI was very diligent on checking my to do list, so nothing ever sat more than a day or so without movement. I do feel if you use RM you need to be on top of your list because they do not notify you when a new task is needed. \\n\\nMy mortgage banker was incredible. He has helped me through the whole process and has worked very well with my realtor. \\n\\nHowever, the second and third RM employees that have been assigned to my file are completely incompetent. I turn to my banker for ALL communications and he is great at getting back to me. I truly feel the banker you are assigned will make or break your experience. I’m lucky, but if I didn’t have him, I don’t think I would have stuck it out with rm. \\n\\nThey did take a 500 deposit the moment my offer was accepted. However, this will go towards closing costs so I am not mad about it. \\n\\nMy rate was locked at 6.1 but did increase to 7.1 after a few adjustments and lender credits were added to my account. This increased my monthly payment by about $100 but it is still well within my budget so again, I’m not mad about it. \\n\\nIf you are flexible and on top of your paperwork, I think RM is a fine option to get the deal done. \\n\\nI close on Tuesday, so if something falls through between then and now I’ll be back to update.</td>\n",

They also sell this information. According to the mortgage agreement you are required to cooperate with them. No other mortgage company does this.\\n\\nDuring the mortgage application process, they tried to charge me 3 points (!!).  I got a competitive quote from another mortgage lender at a much lower cost and RM matched the offer.  I wish I went with the other lender.  The only reason I went with RM at that point was because I was further along in the process and rates where trending higher.   \n",

I have roughly 22k saved up cash with another 3k in stocks if need be. 12k in house savings, 6k in emergency savings, and 4k in car savings. I make 72k a year salary. I have inquired from Rocket mortgage, Chase bank, and Wells Fargo. Rocket mortgage has the most friendly loan officer but haven’t given me an official quote, loan office estimated mid 6 range. Wells Fargo quoted me 6.875 interest and 7.22 APR, and Chase bank seems to have ghosted me. I have - 760-790 credit score depending on bureau. I’m just lost in the process right now. Looking in the 200-250k range for a house. Everyone I have talked to has been confident I can afford 250k and under and have quickly gotten approval letters from rocket mortgage and Wells Fargo.\\n\\nA side note. With my job I get a company truck that I am allowed to use as personal vehicle so I hardly use my 2017 accord and 2004 tundra which are both paid off. So no outstanding debts and no foreseeable need to purchase or repair a vehicle.   \n",
       "2  EDIT: there is an extreme lack of transparency. Refusal to answer direct and deliberate questions. Constant mistakes in the loan disclosures. Just a huge general incompetence that is honestly beyond embarrassing and beyond frustrating being that it’s one of the biggest purchases I’ll probably ever make it my life. Unwillingness to admit fault and fix the errors always pointing blame and shifting the conversation. Truly worst experience I could have imagine working with them. My LO is a joke. \\n\\n\\nI’m going through an absolute nightmare experience with them right now. They did a complete bait and switch on me. literally tripling my estimated closing cost. I feel like they purposely took their time with the appraisal EDIT** (took them 18** days!!!) now that I see the pictures in his report we’re from much earlier than I thought. \\n\\nNow leaving me only nine days till closing and are demanding a whole laundry list of repairs to be done that are not only extremely expensive added up, but most being purely cosmetic (repaint the house and fix some pieces of wood siding and trim) AND I have a conventional loan. The audacity blows my fucking mind. Even if every lender would require the same repairs, the fact that they are not even willing to, except a letter of intent is wrong. I’m being forced to extend my closing date or breach the contract. Which is more money. \\n\\nPlus the loan officer lied to me blatantly lied to me about the closing cost because she knew I plan to go with another lender. I am a first time homebuyer with virtually zero prior experience. Just trying to do research and learn as I go and trust referrals and it bit me in my ass. I did not get the real closing numbers until I had already gave her the $500 good faith deposit which by the way does not go towards anything and it’s money you will never get back. By the way, I asked several times for a formal loan estimate document and it literally took weeks before I got it. She would always confirm things over the phone or through text now I know that’s part of their scam. \\n\\nShe verified with me over the phone 100 times what my closing cost were which evidently was just a blatant lie. Every time I confront her she disappears. The company will not get me in touch with the manager. Nobody there says they can help me. So basically had me convinced that my total costs to close was just the cost of a rate buy down thanks to my seller concessions. She made it very clear. But it was a blatant lie. \\n\\nIt’s already too late to go with another lender because I will not be able to close on time and will have to incur many fees for extending my closing date, and or possibly just breach the contract and risk the extensive cost of that. \\n\\nI don’t even know what to do anymore. Just making this post to warn the people looking at lenders to not take your chances with them.\\n\\nAlso, according to their site, I should qualify for certain lender credits, but they did not honor it. They’re rates were higher than others, but I stayed with them due to this loan program that ended up costs more than it was saving.\\n\\nThe sales woman / LO is very nice on the phone but ultimately misleading so don’t fall for it like I did :)\\n\\nAlso if you try to get in touch with a manger there GOODLUCK. You never will.\\n\\nPS: if it’s not obvious already, I’m just having fun now in the comments and blowing off steam. Don’t take it personal!   \n",

Like many other clueless individuals, I turned to google to begin my mortgage lender search. Of course, from the first moment I searched the web, rocket mortgage has flooded me with targeted ads. So, I caved and went through their pre approval. \\n\\nPre approval was extremely easy. Just a few pieces of basic info and I was approved. Tummy approval was MUCH higher than I anticipated though, so I kept this in mind. When it finally came time to make an offer, the home I secured was $50k lower than my pre approval amount. After a back and forth with my lender they said it was a “tight squeeze” but I could make that amount work. So, that was red flag #1 but, nevertheless, it worked out in my favor. \\n\\nI was very diligent on checking my to do list, so nothing ever sat more than a day or so without movement. I do feel if you use RM you need to be on top of your list because they do not notify you when a new task is needed. \\n\\nMy mortgage banker was incredible. He has helped me through the whole process and has worked very well with my realtor. \\n\\nHowever, the second and third RM employees that have been assigned to my file are completely incompetent. I turn to my banker for ALL communications and he is great at getting back to me. I truly feel the banker you are assigned will make or break your experience. I’m lucky, but if I didn’t have him, I don’t think I would have stuck it out with rm. \\n\\nThey did take a 500 deposit the moment my offer was accepted. However, this will go towards closing costs so I am not mad about it. \\n\\nMy rate was locked at 6.1 but did increase to 7.1 after a few adjustments and lender credits were added to my account. This increased my monthly payment by about $100 but it is still well within my budget so again, I’m not mad about it. \\n\\nIf you are flexible and on top of your paperwork, I think RM is a fine option to get the deal done. \\n\\nI close on Tuesday, so if something falls through between then and now I’ll be back to update.   \n",
