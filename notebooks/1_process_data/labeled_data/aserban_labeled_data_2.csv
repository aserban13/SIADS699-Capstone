1hcgjtw,personalfinance,Rocket Mortgage,"Banker is trying to talk me into a cashout refi instead of a Home Equity Loan. . A little background, trying to borrow \~100k for a home reno. 3 years into my 15yr FHA mortgage at 2.5% with PMI. I owe 149k. Banker is convinced I will save money by just doing a cashout refi, rather than take out a HEL. I guess his numbers make sense if I take 30 years to pay off the second loan, but I plan to pay it much more quickly, maybe 5 years. I just don't have 100k in hand. FWIW this is rocket mortgage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/1hcgjtw,Neutral,aserban
1irwq2g,tax,Turbo Tax,"Should we use turbo tax or get a tax professional?. I have used TT for at least the last 7 years. I got married in 2024 and we had our second child. I also sold a house that I owned before we got married in Georgia. We both have W-2's and a lot of investment accounts (all of those are entered in to TT) My husband really wants us to go to a tax professional to ""find hidden money"" we could potentially get back... he mentioned the child tax credit. It just seems like it isn't necessary to me. We already filed for the child tax credit and the daycare credit.. I spent 4 hours gathering everything and putting it into TT... so what do you guys think? Tax professional the way?",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/1irwq2g,Neutral,aserban
1eniv3b,personalfinance,Wells Fargo,"Roth IRA w/Wells Fargo, rollover IRA w/Fidelity, want to begin investing to grow my money - no idea where to start . I have around $10,000 in a WellsFargo Roth IRA, and about $2,000 in an IRA with Fidelity that I got through an old employer. I want to start buying stocks and investing, etc and am thinking about using the Fidelity account as a ""play"" account to start off, just until I can start understanding how it all works. I know nothing about the stock market, but feel like I'm wasting potential $$$ by just having it sit there. I contribute to my Wells Fargo Roth every paycheck and throw in whatever I can afford thats left over. I haven't added to the Fodelity account since I left that employer over a year ago. Advice? I am looking into meeting with a financial adviser soon.. I don't even know what questions to ask",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/1eniv3b,Neutral,aserban

1i2y510,Comcast_Xfinity,Xfinity,"Xfinity Bill Increase. I’ve been a loyal Comcast/Xfinity customer for nearly 15 years at my home, consistently paying my bill on time. I currently have TV, phone, and gigabit internet services. Over the years, I’ve noticed significant increases in my bill. In just the past year, it has jumped from $250 to $370 a month. While I understand that price increases are sometimes necessary, they seem to be happening more frequently and in larger amounts than before. In today’s economic climate—where inflation continues to impact the cost of basic goods and services like food, utilities, and insurance—it’s becoming increasingly difficult to justify these rising costs. My family and I, along with my brother and his kids, use the internet daily to watch movies, play online games like Roblox, Warzone, Fortnite, listen to music, and spend quality time together. Watching TV and enjoying entertainment together is a big part of our lives. Is there anything you can do to help lower my bill? I’d like to continue enjoying the services we rely on, but the current cost is becoming unsustainable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/1i2y510,Negative,aserban

14ebsgh,RealEstate,Rocket Mortgage,"Housing Market. I wanted to post to vent my frustrations with the housing market. For context, I am a real estate agent. I just started. I understand that people look at comps and say for their size and number of rooms they should be getting a specific price for their house. But can we just take a minute to say people out there right now for rent and overall selling prices are delusional and have to be on drugs. People are trying to rent an 1800 sq ft town house for 6K. You have another home that is for rent thats 5,300 thats only 2,000 sq ft for a new build from 3 years ago when the market was amazing. I get that the interest rates and everything have sky rocketed so the new builds being priced that is ok. I get it. I don't agree with it. But then you have houses with ugly orange cabinets, wood floors from the 90s, and terrible fixtures/bathrooms and they still think they can charge 3k - 4k over what their mortgage is. I can't wait for their homes to not rent and the market to slowly correct. Can't correct fast enough. Hopefully people aren't dumb enough to rent these places.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/14ebsgh,Neutral,aserban

I’m seeing other homes on Zillow with 500-1000 sq ft more (basements) that are selling for only 10k more than what I paid. Every time I look on Zillow, I feel like I’m getting ripped off. I can’t concentrate on anything else. I don’t even know if I could sell this home without taking a huge loss someday because it has no basement. Update: my house is appraised at what I paid for but it doesn’t feel that way whenever I look on Zillow. I have seen larger homes sell for either the same price or slightly more. My home was made several years ago so it feels very plain and overpriced given the materials. I have no basement which I feel is a mistake. Also I needed a home and couldn’t sideline it for long. There was not a whole lot of inventory. If I didn’t buy this month I would have to rent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/13xp25y,Neutral,aserban
