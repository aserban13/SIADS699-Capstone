1hqgmvb,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket Mortgage,"Avoid Rocket Mortgage. I have a RM mortgage and they call me once a year and ask where I am employed, what my salary is, if the house needs any repairs, and they run a soft credit check while I am on the phone with them and run through all my credit card debt. They also sell this information. According to the mortgage agreement you are required to cooperate with them. No other mortgage company does this. During the mortgage application process, they tried to charge me 3 points (!!). I got a competitive quote from another mortgage lender at a much lower cost and RM matched the offer. I wish I went with the other lender. The only reason I went with RM at that point was because I was further along in the process and rates where trending higher.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/1hqgmvb,Negative,aserban
1gum4oc,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket Mortgage,"Is rocket mortgage that bad?. I’m in the market to buy a house now (21m). I have roughly 22k saved up cash with another 3k in stocks if need be. 12k in house savings, 6k in emergency savings, and 4k in car savings. I make 72k a year salary. I have inquired from Rocket mortgage, Chase bank, and Wells Fargo. Rocket mortgage has the most friendly loan officer but haven’t given me an official quote, loan office estimated mid 6 range. Wells Fargo quoted me 6.875 interest and 7.22 APR, and Chase bank seems to have ghosted me. I have - 760-790 credit score depending on bureau. I’m just lost in the process right now. Looking in the 200-250k range for a house. Everyone I have talked to has been confident I can afford 250k and under and have quickly gotten approval letters from rocket mortgage and Wells Fargo. A side note. With my job I get a company truck that I am allowed to use as personal vehicle so I hardly use my 2017 accord and 2004 tundra which are both paid off. So no outstanding debts and no foreseeable need to purchase or repair a vehicle.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/1gum4oc,Neutral,aserban
1541el1,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket Mortgage,"WARNING- do NOT work with rocket mortgage!!!. EDIT: there is an extreme lack of transparency. Refusal to answer direct and deliberate questions. Constant mistakes in the loan disclosures. Just a huge general incompetence that is honestly beyond embarrassing and beyond frustrating being that it’s one of the biggest purchases I’ll probably ever make it my life. Unwillingness to admit fault and fix the errors always pointing blame and shifting the conversation. Truly worst experience I could have imagine working with them. My LO is a joke. I’m going through an absolute nightmare experience with them right now. They did a complete bait and switch on me. literally tripling my estimated closing cost. I feel like they purposely took their time with the appraisal EDIT** (took them 18** days!!!) now that I see the pictures in his report we’re from much earlier than I thought. Now leaving me only nine days till closing and are demanding a whole laundry list of repairs to be done that are not only extremely expensive added up, but most being purely cosmetic (repaint the house and fix some pieces of wood siding and trim) AND I have a conventional loan. The audacity blows my fucking mind. Even if every lender would require the same repairs, the fact that they are not even willing to, except a letter of intent is wrong. I’m being forced to extend my closing date or breach the contract. Which is more money. Plus the loan officer lied to me blatantly lied to me about the closing cost because she knew I plan to go with another lender. I am a first time homebuyer with virtually zero prior experience. Just trying to do research and learn as I go and trust referrals and it bit me in my ass. I did not get the real closing numbers until I had already gave her the $500 good faith deposit which by the way does not go towards anything and it’s money you will never get back. By the way, I asked several times for a formal loan estimate document and it literally took weeks before I got it. She would always confirm things over the phone or through text now I know that’s part of their scam. She verified with me over the phone 100 times what my closing cost were which evidently was just a blatant lie. Every time I confront her she disappears. The company will not get me in touch with the manager. Nobody there says they can help me. So basically had me convinced that my total costs to close was just the cost of a rate buy down thanks to my seller concessions. She made it very clear. But it was a blatant lie. It’s already too late to go with another lender because I will not be able to close on time and will have to incur many fees for extending my closing date, and or possibly just breach the contract and risk the extensive cost of that. I don’t even know what to do anymore. Just making this post to warn the people looking at lenders to not take your chances with them. Also, according to their site, I should qualify for certain lender credits, but they did not honor it. They’re rates were higher than others, but I stayed with them due to this loan program that ended up costs more than it was saving. The sales woman / LO is very nice on the phone but ultimately misleading so don’t fall for it like I did :) Also if you try to get in touch with a manger there GOODLUCK. You never will. PS: if it’s not obvious already, I’m just having fun now in the comments and blowing off steam. Don’t take it personal!",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/1541el1,Negative,aserban
1b3xvqv,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket Mortgage,"Rocket Mortgage: An honest review. As a first time home buyer and a first generation home buyer, I was absolutely lost when it came to the purchase of my first home. Like many other clueless individuals, I turned to google to begin my mortgage lender search. Of course, from the first moment I searched the web, rocket mortgage has flooded me with targeted ads. So, I caved and went through their pre approval. Pre approval was extremely easy. Just a few pieces of basic info and I was approved. Tummy approval was MUCH higher than I anticipated though, so I kept this in mind. When it finally came time to make an offer, the home I secured was $50k lower than my pre approval amount. After a back and forth with my lender they said it was a “tight squeeze” but I could make that amount work. So, that was red flag #1 but, nevertheless, it worked out in my favor. I was very diligent on checking my to do list, so nothing ever sat more than a day or so without movement. I do feel if you use RM you need to be on top of your list because they do not notify you when a new task is needed. My mortgage banker was incredible. He has helped me through the whole process and has worked very well with my realtor. However, the second and third RM employees that have been assigned to my file are completely incompetent. I turn to my banker for ALL communications and he is great at getting back to me. I truly feel the banker you are assigned will make or break your experience. I’m lucky, but if I didn’t have him, I don’t think I would have stuck it out with rm. They did take a 500 deposit the moment my offer was accepted. However, this will go towards closing costs so I am not mad about it. My rate was locked at 6.1 but did increase to 7.1 after a few adjustments and lender credits were added to my account. This increased my monthly payment by about $100 but it is still well within my budget so again, I’m not mad about it. If you are flexible and on top of your paperwork, I think RM is a fine option to get the deal done. I close on Tuesday, so if something falls through between then and now I’ll be back to update.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/1b3xvqv,Positive,aserban

191leob,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket Mortgage,"Another Rocket Mortgage Horror Story. This just happened at the end of 2023. All queued up to buy a house, inspections and appraisals all were good to go and of course we had the pre-approval from rocket as the first step. Well, literally days before closing they basically said we were not approved for a loan ""debt to income ratio was too risky"" etc. I have no idea how such a simple initial credit check/balance sheet got overlooked until the very last moment, but that's definitely not normal. We were first time home buyer FHA and had to meet a lot of requirements to close the deal, this was months of them having our financial info and jumping through hoops. So, 1k EMD and another couple hundred for the inspections and appraisal all down the drain over a deal they were never going to give us. Buyers and sellers BEWARE!

1g00uvu,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket Mortgage,"Rocket Mortgage requiring 700 credit score for traditional mortgage?. Hi, I've recently found a property I really like and am likely going to make an offer on it. I wanted to get a pre-approved mortgage letter to boost my odds of being accepted, and figured it would be easiest to get it through rocket mortgage, and then shop around if/when my offer is accepted. At first they sent me a ""pre-qualified approval"" letter for a traditional mortgage, then the next day they sent me a ""verified approval"" letter for an FHA loan. When I spoke to them on the phone, they stated my credit score of 680 was too low for the underwriters to approve a traditional mortgage that I would need a score of 700. They sent my case to a credit upgrade team, and they reached out to me stating that I would need to pay down 3 of my credit cards to 0, the total balance on these cards being about $1000 dollars with a $15000 limit. Is this normal? I had read that 620 and up was enough to qualify for a traditional mortgage loan. &#x200B; TIA for any insight!",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/1g00uvu,Neutral,aserban
1i7h3qs,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket Mortgage,"Student Loans/Rocket Mortgage/ DTI / Lower loan amount. Hi! So we submitted info for prequalification to several lenders. Rocket Mortgage came back to us first with a preapproval for 240k, which works for us. Then a couple days later, they told me they needed to update the amount to 208k because they verified info on student loans and dti ratio, and they said underwriting decided to use 50% of the student loans projected payments and debt - even when we proved it is in forebearance, and that we have been paying rent+debt+loans when it was required. Now they say I need to pay 8k in credit card debt, and we could get the approval for 208 -which doesn't work for us-. So we will not be working with them, BUT, my concern is if other lenders will consider that too later in the process and we won't be able to close on any deal. Obviously paying 8k would leave us without a bunch of cash we want to use to close. Also, 208 won't help us to close on what we want. We have been paying credit cards debt consistently, and our monthly rent is higher than what we could end up paying for the loan we want... Do you think other lenders will do the same math later in the process? I have submitted all the info they require, and mentioned the student loans, without any effect like that. Any help or advice will be very much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/1i7h3qs,Neutral,aserban
1bldork,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket Mortgage,"First time buyer in unique situation and Rocket Mortgage question. In a bit of a unique situation. I am currently renting a house and my landlord is also a realtor. I had inquired about purchasing the property a year ago but they said it just didn't make sense for them to sell it at the time. Fast forward to a week or so ago, and they asked if we would still like to purchase. The price is contingent on us not having a realtor so she doesn't have to split commission, so I am really struggling and could use some advice.. I got prequalification's from a few different lenders, one being rocket mortgage. They are offering 10K closing costs credits and I just don't understand how this is possible. It just seems weird and was wondering if anyone could tell me if this is legit? Essentially, with a 10K down payment and 13K closing costs, the cash to close is still coming in at roughly 14K due to the credits. Much lower than other lenders. And they are matching any of the other lenders interest rate. 6.5% interest, 14K cash to close (including 10.5K down payment). I just feel like I am missing something. Is there anything I should ask lenders for to be sure? I have been confused with this whole purchase agreement and getting a loan estimate. I thought I got the purchase agreement and then sent that to lenders, but it seems I have to give the financing info to the seller/landlord to get the purchase agreement. And the lenders want the purchase agreement to give me a Loan estimate. So It seems I need to pick the lender before getting a loan estimate which I don't quite understand. It feels odd locking in a lender without having a loan estimate. I know there is a lot to unpack here but I definitely appreciate any help. &#x200B; &#x200B;",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/1bldork,Neutral,aserban

We got a bunch of ads for Rocket Mortgage and filled out an application and got pre approved. We are still shopping around, however today our rep with Rocket Mortgage said something that i was confused on. He let us know we would only qualify for an FHA loan due to my credit being under 700. For reference, here is our info: Joint Income - $215k His credit - 794 My credit - 687 Saved money - 175k (ideally no more than 55k for our downpayment) Debt - a total of $21k between both of us (student loans and one credit card) We are already weary of going with RM due to so many negative experiences, but is it true that we would not qualify anywhere for a conventional loan? Is that typical? Most of the houses in our area are priced much much higher than the maximum FHA amount in our county (we are looking at houses in the $550k range, and the maximum FHA is $498k) , and we would need to spend a decent amount more on a downpayment from our savings, which we ideally wanted to keep for any repairs, furniture, emergencies, etc. I appreciate any and all advice and help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/1govoz7,Neutral,aserban
