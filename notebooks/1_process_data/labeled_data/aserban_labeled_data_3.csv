1j7xeek,realtors,Redfin,"Rocket Mortgage to purchase Real Estate Brokerage Redfin. Redfin is finally selling and to Rocket Mortgage. In 2022 Redfin bought a lender, Bay Equity, for their agents to refer to and now Redfin will be bought by Rocket. First initial thoughts: 1. Whether you like Redfin or not, their agents are Realtors, many are extremely successful and have built great businesses within Redfin. This will be a huge change that is going to impact the industry. Redfin has also moved away from the ""Discount Brokerage"" role, offering a 2.5% Commission product that utilizes more of their website and technology to promote Redfin listings. And besides, the term Discount has only applied to price, many agents are excellent (I've worked with many in my market) and those that hold Redfin itself accountable for Agent performance or lack of, probably should look at their own brokerage, there's bad apples everywhere. 2. Redfin agents will likely now be the beneficiary of those Rocket Mortgage Leads and vice versa where currently, Rocket partners with agents to refer to. 3. This is likely good for both companies, but Redfin will likely lose autonomy and the impact to the Agents? Who knows.

I have been working on my turbo tax, and this part confuses me: You only need to enter SEP IRA contributions made through self-employment work.

(While you could contribute more to an employer-sponsored SEP IRA, TurboTax doesn‚Äôt support these contributions.) Well, I might have messed up? I am self-employed, one man business. I didn't come anywhere near meeting how much I should have contributed because I wasn't aware of any of this till a bit late in the game, but I contributed around 20k. Income around 200kish. Now that sounds like it is me contributing, but when I set up my SEP IRA via Merrill Lynch it shows the website as E-contribs (employer) it says ""total number of employees, 1. But when I go to contribute it says Employer contributions. From my understanding prior, I could be the employer. But does this mean that I cannot use turbo tax?

1d3cyxr,Comcast_Xfinity,Xfinity,"Xfinity has been the worst decision of my adult life. . \*\*This is going to be a very long post, SORRY!\*\* I have been an Xfinity customer for 6 years. For a couple of years, I was pretty happy with the service, customer service was stellar, and most importantly, I could afford it. That is why I kept using them when I moved to a different city and even convinced my father-in-law and brother-in-law to get Xfinity when they moved to my state. I even convinced a couple of friends to switch. In 2021 I was offered a deal if I switched from my then phone line provider to Xfinity Mobile. So I did. I switched and financed a device. I figured this would make my life easier. Last year I had been struggling to pay both my Xfinity Internet and Mobile bills. At this point, my internet bill is over $120 and my mobile bill is over $45. Throughout 2023 I was hit by so many late and reconnection fees and got so behind I could never catch up. Multiple times I would talk to live agents and they would supposedly set up a repayment plan for me. They always reassured me that my service would not be suspended and that I shouldn't worry. But then they would disconnect my internet or Mobile and I would get charged a late fee and a reconnection fee. I was lied to so many times I lost count. I started taking screenshots of the chats as I was starting to doubt myself and sometimes when I would try to save the chat transcript, it would never actually download. I talked to a live agent in November. I wanted to know if I could unlock my device bc I could not afford the phone line with xfinity anymore and needed to switch to a provider I could afford. They told me I still had one more payment and that my phone would be unlocked 48 hours after it was paid off. When my devices was fully paid-off, this NEVER HAPPENED. So my balance continued to grow. I tried multiple times to switch plans but couldn't bc I had a past-due balance. I explained my situation to someone after the device was paid off. Told them I could not afford XfMobile anymore and needed to find a more affordable option for me but that my phone was still locked. I asked if there was any way I could set up a payment plan to pay off the remaining balance and was told that since I had missed the last payment they could not help me with that and they could not restore my service either. So my service had been suspended for a while now and I was still getting charged the monthly fee. I asked if there was any way I could cancel the service and then pay the past balance due since I didn't have the money and was told if I did that then I would be sent to collections! I asked to talk to someone who could maybe give me a different option, I asked for an email or something I could use to file a formal complaint, some live agents just disconnected from the chat, and a couple of them told me they had ""raised my ticket"" but they wouldn't give me a ticket number. On Nov 30th, 2023 I reached out to Xfinity Forums, asked where I could file a formal complaint or talk to someone who could actually address my grievances. I was told to send them a private message, so I did. I explained my situation and how everything had gone down. I asked for a ticket number for the 100th time, but never got one either. They told me to talk to a live chat agent, which is just crazy to me. I had done that countless times, they would either lie to me, tell me they could't help me, or just simply disconnect from the chat. After verifying my email address, they told me they were working on getting a ticket open for me. I NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THEM. I AM STILL WAITING FOR THAT. This was JANUARY 22ND, 2024. They canceled my phone line in January, after a few months of me trying to stop them from charging me for a service I was not using. I haven't had a phone line since January and even tho my phone is fully paid, it is still locked. . I can't receive verification codes or authentication codes, which caused me to lose my job at the time, which I explained to multiple agents too. They recently sent me to Collections! And now they have RUINED MY CREDIT SCORE! I asked them to unlock my phone again, and they told me they won't because I still have balance with them. But THEY SENT ME TO COLLECTIONS! WTF? Everytime I talk to customer service, it seems like they do not care what I say. They tell me to call some number, BUT I CAN'T CALL, YOU WON'T UNLOCK MY PHONE!! I always have to repeat myself multiple times, the agents disconnect, then a different agents picks it up, they say they'll read the chat history, but I still have to repeat myself because THEY DO NOT CARE. All these years being an Xfinity customer, paying my bills on time before all of this, and all I am left with is an account in collections, a ruined credit score, and a unusable phone that I fully paid for. I never do this. I have worked in the customer service industry for over 10 years. I have never left a bad review but I AM EXHAUSTED. I have never felt so disrrespected, taken advantange of, and played. I will make sure this doesn't happen to anyone I know.

1claimh,realtors,Zillow,"What do you think Zillow's long term (1-2 year) play is? Do you think the aim is a foothold to nearly replace buyer agency as we know it?. If I had to guess, Zillow and other big corporations will make a move to replace buyer agents as we know it. They might do some sort of low cost flat fee model (probably around $1000 for the service). **Here is hypothetical scenario #1:** A buyer will see a property that they'd like to see on Zillow. They will click ""Request Showing"". A $15-$20/hour Zillow real estate agent will be called in for a ""Tour"". The buyer will have to sign an agreement explaining the rules and it will likely be a short one such as the 7 day one that they recently announced. They will be made aware that they'll have to pay a $1000 buyer agency fee and Zillow will give the rundown on how it works. If Zillow gets lucky, they'll get a buyer agency fee on top of the $1000 paid by the listing agent and might have some split agreement with the $15-$20/hour agent. **Here's is hypothetical scenario #2:** Zillow's Premier Agent sales decline due to it being harder to close buyer leads. Zillow now stops selling leads and moves 100% to Flex. They lock callers into contracts and then assign those contracts with expert ""partner"" agents. They basically become an OpCity. The goal will be to distribute as many contracts as possible. The partner agent will have to pay a 40%-50% referral fee back to Zillow if it does indeed close. **Here is hypothetical scenario #3:** It becomes hard for agents to close Flex leads due to the fact that buyers want to ""go at it alone"" and go unrepresented, rather than pay a buyer agency fee if the listing agent isn't paying it. On top of that, many agents don't buy Premier Agent leads because they figure their dollars will be best spent on soliciting listings, or just keep in their pocket and try to push referrals. **Here is hypothetical scenario #4:** Zillow continues status quo. Agents who need leads keep buying them because they need clients and see the value in buyer leads. The hybrid of Flex and Premier Agent continues. Zillow finds really on the ball agents to be part of Flex who take on the contracts and close them. They also sell leads as a hybrid to keep their revenue more steady. **Here is hypothetical scenario #5:** Zillow actually becomes a full fledged ""cloud based"" brokerage. They supply leads through their platform and also hire agents across the country. Out of the above 5 scenarios, I'm thinking a combo between ***scenario #1*** **and** ***scenario 4*** is likely where buyer agency becomes an hourly wage + bonus working for companies like Zillow, and Zillow continues to sell leads as long as there are buyers. Side note: As far as listings go, my guess is listing agents everywhere starting competing at 1% listing fees to win listings. 0% to the buyer agent but a discussion with the seller ""we'll cross that bridge if we come to it"" if a buyer agent wants to get paid. It probably won't happen this year, but my guess is mid next year. Sellers of course will get what they pay for and that 1% discount could end up costing them 10-20% in the long run. I think these big corporations that purposely take losses are ready for a race to the bottom. Another side note: I put 1-2 years as ""Long term"" because the way things are going, 1-2 years is an eternity in the real estate world.
