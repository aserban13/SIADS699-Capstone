10,THIS!  I used to work for Rocket Mortgage ( Formally Quicken Loans.   Not only do they treat their employees like totally garbage and over work them (revolving door of employees) they also have the highest closing costs compared to most.  I used to get into trouble trying to help my clients out with better deals.  If they call you just ask them to put you on the DO NOT CALL LIST.  They will most likely ignore you and keep calling.   If they call again just threaten to get a lawyer because you asked to be on the do not call list.  This place is the sleazy salesman of the mortgage world.  Go with a reputable bank or credit union.  The nail in the coffin was when I found out a higher up VP of sales forced himself on multiple woman and all he got was a slap on the wrist and a small demotion.,1hqgmvb,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,2024-12-31 15:12:06,192.0,maz4499,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket,Avoid Rocket Mortgage

12,"After my bank pulled a bait and switch on me I started searching online to try to find some interest rates. I made the mistake of providing my information to Rocket Mortgage. Next day the phone starts ringing. VERY pushy people. Calling 3 or 4 times per day. One person would start talking and then immediately transfer me to someone else who was ""already"" on the line. After telling them I had already been approved for a mortgage through another company and I didn't need their services they just kept talking and pushing. I finally told one person to stop talking and I am hanging up now. Very next day, same thing. I told them to never call me again. Stay away from Rocket. My realtor suggested a local mortgage company that has provided dozens of mortgages for her clients this year. They literally had me approved in 2 days and now I am just waiting for closing. She calls me back quickly and responds to emails. Amazing service.

34,Was far along in the process with RM as well and they kept yanking my chain by not giving me a Pre-Approval letter to send with the offers. Telling me I’m pre approved just submit an offer with confidence. I pulled the rug on them after my offer for my home was accepted. The loan officer called me 5 times in one day and then harassed my realtor after all of us ignoring their calls and telling them I’m going with Better. They couldn’t believe someone backed out THAT far into the underwriting process. That’s how they hook you. You can’t be afraid to say NO.

5,"No offense, but how is it Rocket’s fault that the home needs repairs? It isn’t up to the lender in most cases. The appraiser marked the appraisal as subject to repairs due to peeling and chipping paint which would make your home a wood rot risk. It sounds like if you have an agent they’re the ones at fault for giving you unrealistic expectations for closing, property condition, and appraisal turntimes. So, as far as fixing this. Did you get a copy of the appraisal? And why are you mad that you spent $500 on an appraisal to find out the home needs expensive repairs you would be liable for down the road? I get that buying a home is stressful but the loan officer isn’t at fault, here. Loan estimates are just that. They evolve during the process due to variables like title and homeowners insurance being unknowns. You can get a ballpark number but it’s usually off by a few hundred dollars. Now, if the LO fucked up by promising a rate and charging you for it, or not getting a pricing exception for their fees to compete, that’s another story. Imo you need to assess the situation and put your realtor to work. The sellers let the home go to shit, not you. They can either fix it or risk putting it back on the market and getting a lower offer in a rising rate environment.",1541el1,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,2023-07-19 17:31:01,471.0,justmeAlonekitty,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket,WARNING- do NOT work with rocket mortgage!!!

They will not accept your promise of doing it down the road. No lender will.For closing costs, by law you have to receive your loan estimates and disclosures 3 days after applying.

36,Have you logged in to your Rocket portal and looked at your actual good faith estimate from when you applied? It should be there. Perhaps they estimated your homeowners insurance super low and the one you chose is super high. Perhaps the closing date that you and sellers selected is early in the month versus late in the month (more.per.diem owed at closing). Maybe the property taxes are higher than expected or the HOA requires an upfront fee that they couldnt have known about. I used to be a referral agent for Quicken Loans (what Rocket used to be called) so have probably closed 40 deals with them. Many don't like online lenders in general but I always found them to be very systems driven and hyper communicative. One of my listings sold to a Rocket buyer last month and it closed in 21 days with no issues whatsoever. Hopefully you can come to some resolution! You might want to ask if they would accept money being held in escrow in a contractor/painters name so that you can close and have the work done after closing.

The underwriting for all these loans takes approximately the same amount of time to underwrite 
(quality) the borrower. 
There’s NO WAY they can underwrite loans any faster than any other loan originator.

We did not agree to their loan terms and we told them we were discontinuing business BEFORE both these emails were received.

18,"Realtor here: All buyers and especially first time home buyers should work with a local lender and an experienced realtor. Our job is to protect your earnest money and any money invested for inspections and appraisals. 
An experienced agent will get you with a very good lender way in advance of even shopping for a home so that the buyer has time to make any adjustments that would help them find the best interest rate, turn in all necessary documentation to receive a pre-approval vs. a pre qualification, learn about the different lending options and products. Lastly, to make good decisions based on the amount they are actually approved for and if it’s in line with their lifestyle and financial goals. 
Places like rocket mortgage and even some larger lenders like Chase, may not even send your file to underwriting until a week or two before closing. You do not want surprises, good realtors do not want their clients in the position of being surprised and good lenders do not want that either. 
Local lenders are also much easier to communicate with and they are also able to contact underwriting if any issues arise or go above and beyond to solve a problem. 
Example: The lender I recommend to my clients was up at midnight, during Covid, on the phone with a representative for a school loan (screaming baby in the background) to have her correct a mistake on their accounting that would have blown up my clients deal and lost them earnest money. He called to update me at 1:00 am.

We had nowhere to live, nowhere to go and had lost a ton of money up to this point (earnest money, inspections, moving truck). Well that lit a fire under my ass and I HOUNDED the mortgage brokers office for 2 weeks straight and they ended up cutting us a check for around $3k to help cover the cost of everything all because they didn’t check one date on something. It wasn’t as much as I wanted since we were living in a friends basement during this time with our giant moving truck parked in front of their house and now had to find a new place to rent ASAP, but they at least sent us something. And before anyone comes at me about how I shouldn’t have accepted it as done until it was really done, that’s BS because our circumstances were different from the beginning and I knew it and I made sure our broker knew it also and quadruple checked with him multiple times that we were good to go and every single time it was “yup, I’ve checked all the dates and I know how to do my job so we’re good to go.”",191leob,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,2024-01-08 13:38:02,193.0,always-uninc,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket,Another Rocket Mortgage Horror Story

58,"A pre approval is only a letter saying that based on the basic documentation provided you have been pre approved to ge a home loan for $$. It is in no way a guarantee of getting a home loan. 
Many things can impact your ability to get the loan, and those things are only checked once the loan passes the first automated approval and you get an  approval with conditions. In this stage, you are still not guaranteed to get a home loan. The home loan process is a very complex process and for some people more than others, depending on what shows on your credit history , credit score, type of income, your debt to income ratio, title issues with the home, being self employed, how you get paid, sourcing of income, etc.  another thing is , some costs  can throw your DTI to too much higher than expected, like property insurance ( property insurance rates lately are making it difficult for some borrowers to afford to purchase a home) or property taxes that can be much higher than what your DTI would allow. Also FHA loans have much more strict guidelines. 
Lets talk income for example…. Let’s say you have a variable income. When you did the pre qualification process, you were working 40hrs per week. The LO calculated your income and told you , hey, this is how much home you can afford. Then when you find a home and start the loan process, and the Lender goes to do a Verification of employment, they find out that in the last 2 months, you are actually doing less hours, and average if 35 per week, now the income they can use is based on the hours you have been working and your Debt to income ratio will be higher , as you will be showing less income, and DTI now might just be above what an FHA loan program allow. 
The loan process is very complex. The pre qualification process is not a guarantee  and until you have clear to close, a lot of things can happen.",191leob,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,2024-01-08 13:38:02,193.0,always-uninc,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket,Another Rocket Mortgage Horror Story

12,"In 2008, there was a slew of issues related to affordability and unqualified buyers. However the fundamental cause was a bit different.People started defaulting, and that in and of itself was manageable. However as people defaulted, more homes were foreclosed on and more homes hit the market, this caused prices to free-fall. Now let’s say you owe $400k on a $200k house, and have $100k in money. Your net worth is now -$100k. Even if you can afford payments, it makes more sense to declare bankruptcy and have $0 than it does to be in the hole by $100k.As more people realize this, the price drops more from more foreclosures and the issue builds on itself. This is a big part of the bubble “popping.”Compare that to current times. Most people with mortgages bought or refinanced in 2020/2021 to an absurdly low rate historically. For reference, the payment on a 2% loan is roughly half as much as the payment on a 6% loan.This means that every person with one of these mortgages has absolutely 0 financial incentive to sell their house. So the supply has constricted, meaning there’s a surplus of qualified buyers that could buy if people started defaulting, preventing one of the key structural issues found in 2008.",1elwclh,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,2024-08-06 23:15:59,1812.0,XB1TheGameGoat,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket,So what happens to everyone who bought a house at 7-8%?

Your house has gone up in value by $100k since then. You think now is a great time to sell to “lock in” your equity gains…so you start shopping and realize that not only did your home go up $100k in value…so did all the other homes around you.So you are now looking at buying a $600k+ home at ($500k in debt) at 6%.Your original principal and interest payment at 3.25% was $2175, and the new mortgage payment (still on a $500k loan) jumps to $3000…without a true upgrade in housing.You wisely decide to stay where you are and not sell.

As rates drop I think you will see people that are locked in at the low rates of a few years ago more willing to accept a 5 percent mortgage rate on a new home and sell their current homes. More inventory could lower prices which could in turn put current owners underwater in their homes.

31,"it's going to be far from a downfall. As many said, people will refinance their 7%-8% mortgages. Now, in terms of the housing market, when interest rates go down, what do you think will happen? People like you who have been waiting for interest rates to go down will flood the market. People have the money to buy a house. They're just waiting for the interest rates to go down so they can qualify for more.   
Interest rates go down, demand goes up, prices go up. More people will be selling their homes so supply will be up, but those people will also be buyers. Demand will be higher than supply. It's 2021 all over again. Waiving inspections, offering over asking, etc. Personally, I'd rather buy at a high interest rate and refinance, than buy a house at a higher price with a low interest rate.

39,"FYI, you are a bit off on your timeline and facts regarding the 2008 Great Recession. ARMs did not contribute at all.In the run up to it, to about Aug 2007, banks were doing a lot of 100% financing. Also in itself not terrible. Typical loan would be “80/20”, borrow 80% with a conventional fixed rate loan, the do a HELOC for the remaining 20% using a higher rate ARM that would be at a higher rate representing the higher risk (not PMI, so still deductible) higher risk, sure, but not crazy. But…There was crazy stuff. Some people, like sales, gig workers, etc, have less steady income, so there’s a product called “states income”, I write down a number and say that’s how much I make. Needed for some, but brokers figured out the checks for those numbers were pretty weak, so they could put you in a loan you can’t qualify for by convincing you to do a stated income loan (about a half percent higher rate). Broker gets their money and doesn’t care when you can’t pay in 2 years.but it’s not over yet. They introduced plans where if you can’t make the full payment, pay whatever you can. So you could pay less than the interest rate some months, principal owed goes up, but just that month. Except there weren’t limits, and if what you owed goes up 3% a year and home value goes up 25%, you are making money on margin! Buy!

83,"Things to consider. Some lenders will do a modified refinance when interest rates go down. Always ask when you purchase a home to see what the lender may offer and what the rules would be. When someone refinances and they have equity in the home and take it out at that time they can’t just refinance because they want to depending on the value of the home at refinance. Also if your appraisal doesn’t show your loan  will be 78% or lower to appraised value you would wind up with mortgage insurance. Some lenders waive the appraisal depending on how much you are borrowing.  There are just no one circumstance that applies across the board to everyone.  If you are just refinancing to lower your interest rate always calculate how many months it is going to be before you have the costs recouped. If you are not planning on staying in the home, it may not make financial sense to refinance unless you can get low fees. Always ask your lender questions and get things in writing. There are always people out there that you can ask questions to that you trust.",1elwclh,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,2024-08-06 23:15:59,1812.0,XB1TheGameGoat,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket,So what happens to everyone who bought a house at 7-8%?
84,"So many things…1) There’s no reason that someone automatically has to sell their home because interest rates drop making it cheaper for others to carry the same mortgage. If you finance your car, do you sell it when interest rates drop because you’re jealous of the people paying lower rates?2) People don’t have to sell to take advantage of lower rates. They simply refinance by getting a new mortgage to pay off the old mortgage. 3) I think you’re thinking of the adjustable rate mortgage issue that was a problem in 2008 (when you were 8?). ARM borrowers don’t suffer because of rates going down, they suffer because of rates going up. ARM borrowers at 8% are happy at the thought of rates dropping, not scared. 4) 8% is not a historically high interest rate. It seems shockingly high to someone who’s only known 2-3%.

121,"I just want to clarify a bit over all the simplified versions explained in this post. It's not as simple as borrowing money from another bank at a lower rate to pay the loan you owe to your current bank. Otherwise, the banks will lose money and it's not a good business. What actually happens is called amortized loan. Let me explain how that works with an example. Let's say you borrowed 1 million at 5% annual rate for 30 years. In the end, you will pay the bank 1m + 1m * 0.05 * 30 in interest = 2.5m total, or roughly 833k every 10 years. However, for the first 10 years, the money you pay to the bank is applied towards the interest only, hence amortized. So at the 10th year, even though you've paid the bank 833k, you still owe the bank 1m. Then you refinance at another bank at 3% for 30 years. You actually have to borrow 1m at the new bank to pay your old bank. So after refinancing, you will end up paying 833k in interest to the old bank + 1m you owe to the new bank + 1m * 0.03 * 30 in interest to the new bank= 2.73m total. You end up paying more even after refinancing at a lower rate.",1elwclh,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,2024-08-06 23:15:59,1812.0,XB1TheGameGoat,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket,So what happens to everyone who bought a house at 7-8%?

159,"We did it all backwards.  Our mortgage payment is the same as it was 45 years ago. Started in the 70's with a 27k house in a horrible neighborhood with shootings in our front yard and bars on the windows to 3 houses later to a modest home on the golf course in a private lake community @ 3.25 % interest.  Our kids will owe about 1/3 of the value when we die.   They'll either keep and pay much less than their rent is now or sell and keep the equity.  Paying off was never our goal.  We chose to refinance when rates were low and draw cash from equity instead of drawing from retirement savings.  Household repairs can really suck up savings fast. New roof 30k, a deck replacement now can cost 30k to 50k.  Our last cash-out refi at 3.25% paid to replace our busted HVAC @ 16k  and our dangerous busted driveway at nearly 30K. Our monthly mortgage did not increase and we still have more than half the value in equity.  We also used equity to pay cash for all our vehicles, a built in pool at our last home and a kitchen remodel in our current..  The only loan we've ever had was our mortgage and it's always been about the same give or take a few dollars with each refi.   Sure if you look at the years, we still have 25 years left on a mortgage and we'll be dead before its paid, but we have been able to live on one income since 1980.

182,"I'm glad you figured out the refinance part. But just so you know. 2008 will likely never happen again. At least the same way it happened.People think that because homeowners aren't on variable rates, that other sectors can't collapse. But do you know who IS on variable rates? The US government. They borrow money on 10 year timelines known as ""bonds"" so it was borrowing a shot ton of money 2-3 years ago at almost zero percent. But it was also borrowing money 10 years ago, at a much lower rate as well. As those bonds mature, they need to issue more bonds to pay for the bonds, and the premium, this time at a rate of 4%The US GDP is at about 2%, but government spending accounts for about 6% of that. So the private sector, that actually pays taxes and brings money in, is actually SHRINKING at about 4% and the government is pretending that everything is stronger than it's ever been, especially because it is an election year.So we are basically as a country going to end up like one of those homeowners, whose debt payments surpass the actual value of the asset. Currently, out debt to GDP ratio is about 1.22 and going up as we increase debt, and decrease revenue. How this will shake out, I don't really know.

202,"So, I was about to close on a house in 2008 and thankfully it fell through. The big issue that lead to 2008 was the “balloon” rates, you would sign the dotted line at a decent percent but it would increase over time and if your wages did not also increase sufficiently you were screwed. This was expounded by the fact that these loans were offered to people with poor credit which also could mean they had no idea how the loan actually worked and were looking at it like a credit card instead of a long term financial burden.",1elwclh,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,2024-08-06 23:15:59,1812.0,XB1TheGameGoat,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket,So what happens to everyone who bought a house at 7-8%?

206,"First, the federal government imposed a lot of regulations to stop banks from making loans to people who cannot afford them. Subprime loans were a large part of the 2007 housing bubble that burst. Who knew giving loans to people who normally couldn’t qualify for normal “prime” loans would be a problem. We bought our first home in 2003 at 5.5% 30 year loan. We refinanced in 2012 to a 3% 15 year loan when rates dropped. We saved $56,000 in interest by that simple move. We bought our current home in 2020 when rates were dropping. But the folks who recently bought had to meet the stricter standards to qualify for their loans. When rates start dropping, they’ll refinance into cheaper interest rates and pocket the savings.ETA: ARM loans were also targeted for regulation in the aftermath of 2008.",1elwclh,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,2024-08-06 23:15:59,1812.0,XB1TheGameGoat,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket,So what happens to everyone who bought a house at 7-8%?

1,"Rocket sucks.they built a great marketing team to dominate search ads and an annoying AF call center to wear people down. They are excellent salespeople, but the operations side is far less reliable.  It isn't that they qualify any more or less or differently, but with a local broker you know the banker and the admin and how to reach them. With Rocket, you can get anyone each time you call, and no one is local to know your city / county / state inside and out. With a local person, they often send someone to closing in case anything goes wrong or even host it at their office. With Rocket, good luck. It just isn't worth it.That being said, Rocket is big, im sure someone has had a good or acceptable experience. I've found it always comes down to the loan officer - the good ones are organized and helpful regardless of where they work. The bad ones aren't and can work anywhere too.",1dsvgdt,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,2024-07-01 15:14:02,104.0,coconutmonkfish,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,Rocket,Opinions on Rocket Mortgage 
2,"Being a new permanent resident is fine - it's not the citizenship/residence status that matters now that you are a resident but lack of credit history is going to be a struggle for you.

3,I thought about going with them initially but after being rejected on a house early on for not choosing a local lender as they are easier to work with for everyone involved. Fast forward to 8 offers later we win largely because of the local lender/local agent.

8,"We had a great experience with Rocket. They have a portal where you submit all of your paperwork so you know exactly what needs to be submitted and when. We had 1 loan officer throughout the process who was seriously the nicest most patient person I’ve ever worked with. She went out of her way to make sure our loan got approved and everything on their end was completed so we could close a little early (sellers request). She called us 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after we closed to make sure our house was in good shape, we weren’t having any issues with the app, and follow up with some questions we had asked after close. We’ve not been in our house for about a year and a half and we called the other day about taking out a HELOC for some repairs and we unfortunately aren’t working with the same person but the new guy is just as friendly and responsive. The app is awesome to set up automatic payments, keep track of your escrow account, access tax documents, calculate how extra payments affect your loan, etc. In comparison my brother bought a house right around the same time and his loan has been sold twice and caused a ton of headache because some of his payments haven’t transferred with the sale. He’s spent several months fighting with the new bank to prove that the old bank should have had the payments. They also don’t have an app so he has to wire his payment each month which is overall just inconvenient. I think rocket is perfect for a FTHB as you’re trying to learn the ropes and keep track of a new expense.

10,We ended using them and have been happy.

11,I applied to two locals and Rocket.  Ultimately after negotiating Rocket gave me the best combination of fees and rate. At each phase of the loan I had a contact person I could get on the phone.

13,"Loan Originator here. Rocket works if you are A paper with nothing slightly out of the norm (I have restructured two wholesale loans to rocket that they denied on the retail side). They are not the fastest for closing, so depending on your market that could be an issue. As others have recommended, If you want to go with them try a broker who wholesales to them. It gives the borrower slightly more control on timelines and a broker is usually going to have a little bit more knowledge on the loan than the average phone rep at rocket.That being said, you being a permanent resident, that wont disqualify you from any lending opportunities. You can still get an FHA loan and qualify for down payment assistance programs if that is what you are seeking. Main issue is the credit.  
ALWAYS make sure when getting pricing quotes to ask ""Is this the PAR rate or with discount points?"" Sometimes lenders will quote you a rate that you have to pay closing costs for. Par rate is the rate closest to no cost to you as the borrower.   
Regarding credit. get on some of her accounts asap as an authorized user. You can try to supplement some tradelines with bills paid under your name if you have a 12 month history of paying them. There are also certain private lenders that will take the credit of the higher income earner if you are married. In your case that may not work, but if part of your 85K is not salary and cant be used with less than 12 months of receipt you may be able to take advantage of those programs.  
Wishing you the best and for the love of gosh almighty, get a fixed rate please! no ARMs. also, this is the best way to shop IMO. apply with a few places (within 14 day timeframe of each other). Get them all to quote you a rate on the same day (markets can change once to twice a day so comparing quotes from different days isnt an accurate reflection). Once you have all 3 quotes, take the cheapest rate to the lender you like the service from best. many of us are restricted on the rates we can sell but we can request pricing exceptions to beat out competition. this business is extremely competitive but you will not get the best price just by asking for it unfortunately. If the best service lender is able to match the rate, you're getting the best of both worlds.

21,went thru their application process for a refi which was straight forward enough. One thing I did like that they confirmed was that your payments get applied when you send them in partially.

Just an unholy amount of random people calling and asking for the same information provided weeks ago. Finally our realtor came to us and said “Dude I’ve been doing this a long time and they are not responding or providing basic information that is required for every transaction. You should consider other lenders”. We immediately dipped and went with our local credit union after getting some debt wiped out which made us eligible for a larger loan. Most stressful three months of my entire life. Rocket continued to spam email and call us for months after we left their service. That was the only time they started responding. When we dumped them.

49,Rocket's origination fees were crazy high (like 8k) for me and their sales were pushy as hell. They tried to get me to buy down a rate for a 7 year arm which is a few inches short of a scam as far as I'm concerned. I ended up going with a local lender which saved me about $3k in origination with the same rate on a 30 year conventional. If you put your information in LendingTree or Bankrate you'll get more than enough loan pre-approvals than you can shake a stick at and then narrow it down from there. I get that everyone in the comments has a great experience with them but that's because they shelled out a few mortgage payments for that service.

38,"Title: Rocket Mortgage Review: Fast, Efficient, and Surprisingly SmoothHey Reddit, I recently wrapped up buying a home with Rocket Mortgage and had to come share my experience because it was unexpectedly smooth. I’m 65 and this isn’t my first rodeo—I’ve bought homes before, but nothing like this.After filling out their online form, Rocket Mortgage’s AI quickly assessed that a soft credit pull and my current pay stub were enough to consider me low-risk. This sped up the process significantly, and from start to finish, the entire thing—from application to closing—was done in just 10 business days, concluding on April 19, 2024.The appraisal was quick too, completed in just four days and it even came in a bit higher than needed, which definitely helped things along. Another plus was the closing costs, which were under $2,000, and I locked in a 6.99% fixed rate, which felt like a win given the market.But the real highlight was the closing process itself. It was all online, conducted via a video call with an AMROCK notary and took only about 25 minutes. The documents were well written and easy to understand, and the signing was made simple with their ClearSign process. Everything was logical and user-friendly, which isn’t always the case with mortgage paperwork.For those of you with solid credit and a straightforward job history, Rocket Mortgage might just revolutionize your home buying experience. They’re not just using tech for the sake of it; they’re using it to genuinely improve the process, making it faster, clearer, and much less of a hassle.

45,"I’m having a nightmare experience with Rocket because they’re not local.  I had a tree fall on my house and put a big hole in the outer brick wall and roof.  My homeowners insurance company, USAA, cut me a large check to get repairs going ASAP but had to include Rocket Mortgage on the check.  So I had to endorse it and send it to Rocket Mortgage to also endorse.  I overnighted it to them with USPS, and no one was available to sign for it on the first attempt to deliver at 11:30 am on a Thursday.  So they got it the next day and logged it in their system.  I’ve been calling for a week and am told it takes 7-10 business days to endorse an insurance check.  WTF!! Then they’ll send it back to me.  In the mean time I can’t get the house repaired because I don’t have the insurance check back.  So this experience has made me regret not using a local bank for my mortgage.

The first time it did not arrive by the due date so I had to pay it out of my pocket, and once my insurance company received RM check, they refunded my payment back to me.  When calling RM about this, they apologized and said there was a mix up.  Not sure how, but I left it alone.  My 2024 prem is due by 8/1.  I notice 7/30 payment is still due for my prem.  I call RM and was told they mailed the payment on 7/23, it takes 10 business days to be settled. I asked if it takes 10 business days, and you know this, why was it mailed on 7/23?  10 business days would not allow it to arrive by the due date of 8/1.  I was told, "" I am not sure.  I can see a request was sent to have it mailed in June."" The I was asked "" Doesn't  your carrier allow for a grace period."" I asked a few more questions and still told "" I don't know.  I understand"".  I sent an email to the support team asking the questions that the RM customer service could not answer.  ""Megan"" from the support team replied to my email just simply to say ""I see you talked with a customer service member.  Please let   me know if there is anything else.""  I am guessing Megan is a BOT, she could not have read my email.  Anyways, it seems I will have to pay my insurance prem once again out of pocket, and wait until RM check arrives.  HORRIBLE Service.

My husband in on disability , in between short term ending and long term starting there's a 2 month down period no pay. We managed to keep small mortgage current . We fell behind on larger one. I called (many many) times and asked if they would work with us. At first I just wanted an extension but Rocket mtg doesn't do that, applied for hardship explaining I wanted an option I could pay May and June in July and then pay  July and August in August by the 16th .We managed to get the money on Aug 12th so I made the patment on the 12th. . The 19th my account is $2000 and something in the hole. Rocket mortgage took 2695 (a different amount of what we had talked abiout ) ) out of our account and refuses to refund the money AND they still expect a payment in September  They explained to me it was my fault because I had made the payment before the 16th. I never gave Auth to remove funds on the 16th I said I would pay by the 16th and I did early on thr 12th.  Terminal brain cancer isn't severe enough for a hardship case even tho I told then repeatedly that I would be able to come current in 2 months. We have had our mortgage for 16 years and this is the first missed payment.  We had a small bump and Rocket was not helpful in any way shape or way. In face there was a rep that laughed when I was  explaining the situation to him.

Eventually, he pulled my credit and said he would work on it and get back to me the next week because I was on vacation. While on vacation he said he had me at 5.75 so I was pretty excited to get back and get a better rate. When he called he immediately sounded confused like we never talked about my situation and what I was looking for. So he tells me ""Oh, I was a little confused I thought you wanted to refinance both mortgages"". He knew better. I was very specific about what I needed and his rate went from 5.75 to 8%.

It went up because he didn’t do his job and they also didn’t give us the promised incentives that they originally stated. we still ended up closing because the math worked out significantly in our favor. Also the day We were supposed to close that person canceled on us so they sent a local notary to close. It was extremely Weird. The guy who who close us was a private sector contractor and he literally did it on his lunch break. Also I don’t know if rocket mortgage holds mortgages or if they sell them right away.

Luckily, being a refi, I was not in a huge rush, and it wasn't like I had a seller to deal with.I did like their rate, fee structure, and overall communication/staff availability. I have had other lenders where the process was a black hole, which was worse. It was part of a promotion, so they covered most of the closing costs. Their portal was easy to use, and they have been good to work with in terms of servicing the loan.The underwriting/verification process was terrible.   A team of coked up ground squirrels would have been less erratic.  It was like they had a big wheel, and they just spin it to generate random requests for documentation.  For example, after I provided the initially requested information, they came back and asked for a mortgage statement for another property I own.  This wasn't in any way linked to the refinance, but fine.  The thing is, I paid cash for the property, so there was no mortgage statement.  I called and talked to the person coordinating the process, and they had nothing to offer.  They said that until that item was cleared in their system, they couldn't do anything.  I ended up creating a Word document that just said, ""No mortgage.  Paid cash"" and uploaded.  It seemed to satisfy them, but I should have been able to do that on the phone.  There were a half dozen weird things like it, and just when you thought things were done, they came up with something else.  All ticky-tacky stuff.Then, they screwed up the closing documents.  Pretty big things like the wrong property legal description and math errors on the disclosure forms.  Not the kind of typos you can just clean up later.

Now several months later when I spoke to an agent I have to do a complete cash out refi. Starting all over at a 30 year mortgage not to mention the interest rates. You would think after being with the same lender for 15 years I could trust them. It started as quicken loans and then rocket mortgage. I am going to look at my contract. So happy I saw this post.

1,"Part 1 of 2An open letter to the CEO of RKT,I’m writing to you on behalf of thousands of super powerful mortgage bankers and banking team members, the silent majority. Please step down from your role as CEO, you have failed us. As our leader the fault for this past years turmoil in the banking world and the stock performance is on your shoulders. They say the captain must go down with the ship, and its become clear you’ve already boarded your life boat and are now watching the wreck from afar. Being the owners friend or an original banker here does not qualify you to be the CEO of such a large organization. He’d be so disappointed with what you’ve done to us, if he knew. Rather than laying off banking staff with a severance (or even just a verbal thank you), you instead chose the heartless path of attrition so you can avoid public news of layoffs. You made jokes about lender layoffs so I understand why you’re doing this. That was a cowardly move, the damage you inflicted by avoiding layoffs is unthinkable. Now you have thousands of underpaid and disgruntled banking TMs who have unrestricted access to your proprietary systems, they’re talking with your clients and acting as the face of the organization, do you assume they will continue to act within the organization’s best interests for little to no pay? A recipe for disaster.You forced TMs to cash out their 401k and tap into savings to make ends meet. You recklessly slapped the prefix “Rocket” on every business endeavor we encounter as if we’re Apple or Google, even eliminated our beloved QL namesake that would have performed better and had more brand recognition. You spent unholy amounts on marketing during times when rates were so low marketing wasn’t even necessary, why’d you do a flashy SuperBowl ad when rates were 2%. You chose to acquire companies without 1st consulting the banker force, with our money, to the tune of billions. The Truebill acquisition cost each banker about $300k from the warchest, imagine what $300k could do for a bankers family right now. You abused our book of currently serviced clients treating it as a source of endless lead flow, harassing them even when no benefit exists, tarnishing our reputation with the clients who have already done business with us. You did this all with a smile on your face and a smug “we’ll get through this” demeanor while knowing not all of us TMs will make it through this. Most comical of all you do these things while still looking to hire more TMs, simultaneously terminating the already trained and devoted team members who want to stay here, have you no soul? Did you trade that soul in for 5,975,000 shares of RKT? You made the decision to cause great financial harm to thousands of loyal team members without communicating this objective directly to them. You’ve treated me and my crew of awesome banking peers as nothing more than a number, a disposable cog in the wheel, a “seat in a desk” as the Ferrari driving CFO would say. The same banking staff who made it possible for you to become a millionaire many times over. The same banking staff who lifted this company from a small office branch up to the largest originator in the nation. The same banking staff who won the JD Power award time after time. The same banking staff who amazed millions of clients across the country with their chipper attitudes and impressive origination knowledge. That same banking staff is now showing up to work quaking in their boots wondering if they will even have a job, wondering if they will be able to reach your unattainable production goals, feeling worthless and deserted by the company they helped build. All while having to hear you gloat in about market share and the bright future of RKT, what about the future of our dinner table tonight? This company is 100% financed by the banking staff, every aspect of it is funded off the backs of bankers who have sat quietly for years knowing their piece of the pie was smaller than it should be, they allowed it to happen for the greater good of RKT. Those same TMs are now either terminated or still here earning an unlivable wage while they watch staff at nonessential sister companies collect their full salary sponsored by our hard work. 26,000 TMs here and you chose to screw the ones that bring in all the revenue? Per recent public filings RKT had 2nd quarter expenses of $1.2Billion, had $1.6Billion in expenses the 1st quarter, where is this money going? It sure isn’t being paid to the banking staff where it belongs. UWM’s expenses for the same quarter was ONE BILLION dollars less than ours, while originating more than we did. The banking staff base annual salary has remained unchanged for ages, 15 years or more to my knowledge, with no adjustments for inflation. We blew 1.2B in expenses but banking staff is earning a couple thousand dollars a month on average, it’s not adding up? Maybe time to quit rebuilding Detroit and start rebuilding the trust your TMs once had in you? It’s dwindling fast.Working with you is like being in a street gang where we go out and rob innocent people, but after the robbery you only share 10% of the plunder with us even though we originated the heist for you. How can you sleep at night knowing you’re destroying families who diligently work for you and have for years? How can you sleep at night knowing the company sits atop a mountain of several billion dollars but has chosen not to pay a livable wage to it’s banking staff? Do you assume the bankers will work and follow all your excessive directions while earning minimum wage?Rocket mortgage is top 5 most expensive lenders in the nation while simultaneously paying their banking staff a lower wage per closed loan volume than any other lender in history by a wide margin. Who gave you permission to pay TMs mere hundreds of dollars for a loan closing that nets you thousands?When the company transitioned to the power banking model it was tolerated because of low rates and high volume, it allowed for bankers to earn an “industry average” even though they were originating 10x more than their industry peers, while working harder and putting in more hours than industry peers for the same annual income or less. We were tricked into believing that Rocket was the only place that had e-sign technology or spent money on marketing so OF COURSE it was okay to pay us 10 bps on closings or less. We were told the volume of leads was so high and process so easy that we didn’t deserve to be paid the industry standard 50-100 bps+, instead we will be paid a tenth of that, because why not! Bankers avoided speaking up because they were earning 10-15k a month. Many bankers had no clue that based on their closed volume that same monthly pay should have been 50-75k, everyone kept quiet because their wages were livable, and likely more than they ever earned in the past. Fast forward to today this pay scale doesn’t even allow folks to pay their bills, yet here you are threatening them with termination and blaming the market shift on their lack of effort or skill. You should be ashamed of yourself. That goes for any of you DMB/RVPs falling in line too, speak up for your TMs or quit calling yourself a leader.",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread

3,"Part 2 of 2Ive heard the CFO ignorantly say many times, our clients were “just fish jumpin in the boat”. No idiot, these clients were not fish jumpin in a boat, they were living breathing American homeowners, we had to bust our asses to earn their business and close their loans, understand? If you are not yet aware *z team* let me be the first to tell you, the market is not in a position to allow for power banking anymore, or anything that even resembles it, not for one more month or even one more minute. You should’ve switched back to *paid on closings* model several months ago when the market tanked and started paying the banking TMs based on closed volume. Instead you chose to choke them out, paying poverty wages. Not to mention the “overtime” we deserve but are not paid (how is that legal). To add insult to injury you start paying out tiny closing bonuses SEVERAL MONTHS after the closing occurs, maybe to entice desperate TMs to stay a bit longer (a very slimy unethical tactic). If the TM closes the loan and is owed the bonus at the time of closing, why aren’t they be entitled to it after leaving, the company already got paid why shouldn’t the originator? These kind of head scratching decisions are being made under your belt.When big companies lose their magic the CEO is swiftly removed and a new one is given an opportunity to succeed, see Disney recently. The magic here is gone under your reign. This is your chance to salvage whatever bit of respect the banking staff has for you, hang up your hat and ride off into the sunset as a handsome multimillionaire. Take the CFO and the boomski guy with you, along with any Z team staff who agree with your *steal from banking to fund the sister companies* agenda. We’ve heard the story about *you know what* with *you know who* and I won’t mention it here as its inappropriate, but you’re past due to address that whether its true or not. Rather than explain yourself, why not pass the torch on to someone who can try to bring back the awesome warm fuzzy family culture we all signed up for. Most importantly choose a successor who cares MORE about the banking staff than having a pissing match with a competitor. You lost the pissing match, and you lost the respect of your banking staff, it’s over. If you truly care about the future of Rocket Mortgage and the well-being of the staff, you’ll choose a successor who has both the banking staff’s best interests at heart as well as the clients fiduciary interests. If you don’t care you’ll remain as CEO and continue to use our money to buy millions of dollars worth of RKT shares while sending us the middle finger with your silence.

5,"I quit a month ago and I'm finally ready to share my experience.One thing to understand about me is I truly do live my life trying to be a good person to other people and was raised to work hard and always do the right thing. I love helping people. I was sold on the idea of being able to 'help' clients when I was hired in July 2020. I started banking in September 2020, and while the hours have always been hell, I went back and forth on quitting in early 2021, I stayed because I was able to help clients lower their rate and help their situations. I enjoyed connecting with people. I was never in this because I got a hard on from SALES. SALES SALES SALES RUN THE PLAY SELL THE CLIENT RUN THE PLAY. I dream about confidence and control like I use to about restaurant patrons asking for diet coke and ranch. Alas, I enjoyed banking because I was able to seemingly improve people's lives, which is really all I want to do in my life.I start with this, because after evaluating my experience, from December 2021-May 2022 I was gaslighted as f\*\*\*. DTRT, numbers and money follow they do not lead, always raising your level of awareness - it is all a lie. The ISMs are not followed at this company, and I cannot believe the power leadership has over everyone to convince them otherwise.I could dive into so much that I am angry about, but I would like to simply share what led to the ending of my employment. In March, our refi region was told that our lead flow was janky and not routing correctly (we were put on a new system that effected how leads were being transferred to us), so we were all paid floor (our entire commission regardless of how many loans we sold) for February and March. That was the company DOING THE RIGHT THING for us and we should all be SO GRATEFUL. smh. During Feb and March, I had an issue with my medication (ADHD and depression) not getting filled, it definitely effected my performance, and on top of admit-tingly trash lead flow (where I would sit and wait for calls 6+ hours a day) I wrote a collective total of 5 loans (during the peak of low rates I would write about 20-30 loans a month give or take). Yet, end of March (march madness), got back on my meds, and was feeling great again. Keep in mind, I was 100% transparent about my medication issue with my director and he understood.Fast forward to end of April. I am provided with an award I have wanted the entire time I've been employed at RKT for how much I live the 'culture', and I am ecstatic and proud. Two days later, I am put on letter for my production in Feb and March. I am blown away by this entirely, as I communicated my medication issues as well as the fact that the company LITERALLY PAID US FLOOR PAY FOR ADMITTING LEAD FLOW WAS TRASH. I am aware I could have (and probably should have) fought this, but me being proud and a hard worker, I just said F it I will put my head down and work, I am going to get off letter because I do not deserve this.For three weeks, I worked 65-70 hours a week, every single day, looking for business. There is none, and rates are up, and being told that 'I am running the plays just keep doing it, it will work' when I had not written a loan in 2 weeks finally sent me into an immediate 'I am done doing this' mode and I quit. There was no possible way I was going to get off letter and hit my goal (of 14 mind you, 14 loans in this trash af market). I was given an impossible task.It is clear as day to me now that this company does not give a single f\*\*\* about good people who work hard and took care of their clients. I never had one client complaint, I helped new teammates constantly, I lived the ISMs, and I was told to go f\*\*\* myself.I am angry. I am hurt. I gave so much of my time and effort to this company. I did literally every single thing I was told.If you are still working for RKT, you are either apart of the big club (as I imagine George Carlin saying this in his voice) or you are on a list of people who are eventually gonna get kicked to the curb too.I never replied to my end of employment email, nor did I read it. TRS if you are reading this, this is my exit interview. GFY.",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread

7,"\*Long Post Alert\*I have been watching this thread for a while and I've gone back and forth about posting multiple times. The tipping point for me is seeing all of these posts from discouraged Rocket employees that feel stuck and don't know what to do. Especially employees and bankers that are in their first 12 or so months of being with Rocket. I was a banker with Rocket for about 8 years before I left this year. TC banker, top performer, blah blah, you get it. The point is, I spent serious time at this company and I have felt and experienced many ups and downs (very little pay at times for tons of hours/work,  trips that were cancelled after winning contests, promotions that were taken away because of BS metrics that suddenly mattered out of thin air). The worst part is... I CHOSE to stick it out. I chose to endure the BS that comes with working at this company for various reasons. I loved my DMB, I loved my team and I loved the earnings potential that came with being a banker. In my opinion, it's a lot easier to deal with this BS when you're making good money. When the market flips and everyone is struggling, the shit that you're put through on a daily basis becomes too much to handle. Call me shallow, but I always knew that I was putting up with the BS for the paycheck at the end of the day. I resigned from Rocket at the beginning of this year and I'm now working for a broker. LIFE DOES GO ON AFTER QUITTING, I promise. Rocket definitely pushes the idea that if you leave the company you are a quitter/failure and you won't last anywhere else. That isn't true. It's a tactic that creates self doubt and prevents bankers from resigning and it worked on me for a long time too. There are tons of lenders and brokers that you can go to that provide a better work/life balance if you choose to stay in the industry. The notion that leaving Rocket means you'll just hop around lenders until you leave the industry is absurd. To give an idea of what the outside world looks like to some of you less tenured bankers, you can work at a broker and make about 1-2% (100-200 basis points) on the loan volume that you are closing. Meaning that you can literally close 2-3 loans PER MONTH and make $10-15k+ on those two or three loans. I point this out to show that the goals and number/volume of loans being written by bankers at Rocket is crazy high and not normal for the industry. I didn't know that until I was with Rocket for years, so I feel compelled to share that info. You don't need to write 20+ loans per month to make good money outside of Rocket. I think it's worth pointing out that the Mortgage industry right now is shit. It's the hardest time to be an LO that it's been since 2008. Nearly every LO is feeling it. The only LO's that are doing well are the loan officers that built a network and are continuing to get tons of referrals, but that is not the majority of us. I'm pointing this out because the newer bankers that didn't get the chance to bank pre 2022 don't understand. Tons of bankers at Rocket were making $300k+ in 2020 and 2021 when the market was good. You CAN make a ton of money at Rocket and there are bankers that are still making good money right now, but they are unfortunately few and far between. The company simply has too many bankers right now in a time where lead flow is light/garbage. This is an industry problem, not just a Rocket problem. There is not enough to feed everyone and it's going to continue to be this way for the next 1-2 years IMO (hopefully less of course). This is why building your own network and obtaining your own referral partners is by far the best thing that you can do to be successful in this industry long term. If you create your own leads/clients, you hold the power and you can literally work anywhere you want and work whatever hours you want.If you do choose to stick it out at Rocket, I do want to say that it's not ALL bad. This is a company that employs 25k+ people. There are some bad apples (some would say many), but there are also some REALLY incredible people that work at this company. I truly hope that Rocket can turn things around for the sake of the employees, because I've met some of the most amazing people working at this company (in ops, banking, client service, across all divisions). Many of the issues that are talked about within this thread have been issues for a long time unfortunately because they are systemic issues and they will remain issues in the future. I do think that a lot of the issues within leadership became more prevalent during covid. Picture this: Covid hits one day, we all go home, rates drop and the business SKYROCKETS. People are promoted left and right and Rocket can't even hire and promote fast enough to keep up with the insane amount of growth. In this explosive growth, TONS of leaders were promoted that truly would not have become leaders in the past. This does not explain all of the leadership issues, but I personally feel that Rocket is NOT the same company that is was prior to 2020. This company has become a shell of itself and by the time I quit this year, I no longer recognized the company that I worked for. Maybe I am mistaken, maybe this has more to do with Rocket going public, maybe it's a combo of the IPO and the explosive growth, who knows. If you take away anything from this, please take away the fact that YOU CAN leave this company and continue to be successful. Whether that means going to another lender, or going to an outside industry, you CAN be successful. Success is a choice. It's not something that falls into your lap because you work for the ""#1 rated lender"" (now #2 lol) in the country. Real talk, it has taken me months to process the BS that i dealt with at Rocket and I am STILL processing. The comments about leaving a toxic relationship make me laugh because there is some serious accuracy. The worst part is that I know for a fact tons of people had it much worse than I did and I still struggle to accept the fact that I chose to drink the Kool aid remain an employee for years through the abuse. I feel as if I was a part of the problem, I just couldn't recognize it when I was within the company. I come back to this forum daily now and read what people are going through and it makes me sad/mad and all the above. Choose yourself. Choose your family. Choose to LIVE and be HAPPY above everything else. If you like being at Rocket that's great, but don't stay because you're too scared to leave or you feel a false sense of loyalty to a company that will replace you the instant you leave. YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF. Best of luck to everyone. I truly wish everyone the best and I hope everyone finds success and happiness whether they stay at Rocket or leave.",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread
8,"The hilarious shit just happened. Tim Birkmier pulled up this megathread in front of a bunch of people and said, ""this is the reason people won't go into leadership in our company."" My guy, you are so delusional that you can't take a hard look in the mirror and see the real issues? Here they are:1) The corporate culture is straight-up toxic. The isms, which are supposed to be a moral guidepost for those with none, are used against bankers to get them to do things. For example, I had a director say,  ""we need to 'do the right thing' and work this weekend. This came after dropping pay by 48%  on the commission structure. Some families won't make it because of these changes. This is not a good way to coerce people into working for lower wages. Doing the right thing is paying your employee's fair wages despite challenges im the market. Man up and fire people if you need to downsize, don't give them hope, then string them long until they are desperate.
2) The senior leadership is nothing less than delusional. They think, or at least project, that they care about the employees and clients. We have over 1 billion dollars on the balance sheet. Why is our pay cut by 48% if that's the case and they care? The stock price is the only real focus. Jay can keep up just as much with his limp dick.
3) Your non-compete will prevent you from working for 12 months after termination. The pay isn't worth it. The non-compete is weak and has been lost in court several times. And if Rocket is superior in technology and product. Why are they so afraid of competitors? Does the strategy of underpaying and overworking your bankers lead to a less desirable product? What a surprise. Didn't see that coming, Jay? 
4) Micromanaging is the name of the game; your mental health is going to suffer. Most of the people in leadership have IQs below 70. While that creates some great order takers, your company will run into the ground with a simpleton at the helm.
5) The company pushes products that aren't financially beneficial. Surprisingly, they haven't been investigated yet. These 27-year products get around net tangible benefits shortening the term and raising the rate—what a joke.
6) Sexual harassment scandals run rampant at this place. Senior leaders sleeping with subordinates (females) is prevalent, and I can't even count how many demotions or firings I have seen for it.
I have worked here a long time and am a top producer. It was a great place to work until we went public. Jay, Tim, if you guys have any balls left to fix a sinking ship, then focus on the people again; otherwise, this one is going down.",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread
9," Hi I think it’s my time to share my story. I worked at rkt from 2020-2023. I truly believed this would be a life long career for me. I sipped that kool aid. I was told that rkt protected their bankers and that we were “recession proof”. (30% banking force reduce) but anyways… My mental health declined drastically working here. I was on several medications and anxiety pills. I went to therapy. I completely lost myself. I felt empty. You know that episode where squidward repeats the same day over and over. That’s what I felt like. The only reason I lasted this long was my 2 dmbs that I had and the team I was on. I specifically was in digital aka chat. I was placed on letter for production “bottom 10%” February 9th. Mind you the shortest month out the year!! I was told I have two options. Either I hustle put in extra time or quit and give up. Same day I was placed on letter I wrote 4 apps and Bobi’d 3. I was asked to write a short summary for “tips from the top” for Jason pace. I felt like a fraud. Needless to say I beat my letter. Fast forward June 3rd. I was fired for being bottom 5%. The way I was fired was humiliating and demoralizing. You’re asked to come into the office in a glass room… where everyone on the sales floor can see you. All my peers I’ve worked and trained with can see me in the room being fired.  They have TRS plastered on a huge tv screen, my SVP, dmb and sudo “rvp” since all rvps got demoted (iykyk) I wasn’t allowed to pack my own bag. I was escorted out like a criminal. I mean these were people that I truly believed were my friends and almost family like since I spent 70hrs+ a week there. I spent more time with my coworkers than my actual family. I was completely broken. Fast forward now end of June I’m off all medications, my mental health has improved and I feel like a human again. I felt like I was in a cult with Stockholm syndrome. Now I hear that leaders who spoke up and gave “push back” to pace about working on non scheduled weekends and scheduled weekend hours going up. They were all demoted. Imagine that. Anyways I can go on and on and share my story but this is the bulk of it. My advice? You are more than a number and never let a job steal your life. They will replace you in a blink of an eye. So why let them suck the life out of you. Don't give your career the power to define you. Take charge, find balance, and live the life you want. Remember, your job is how you make a living, not how you live.",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread

11,"I’ve been watching this thread for a while and left within the last few months and only goes to show how validating it is to hear everyone’s experiences. This place ruined my life. I was there over 6 yrs. I made good money while I was in gold/silver tier. I was forced into debt when I got put into bronze tier and had to take a personal loan  to keep myself afloat while I dug myself out of that grave. I can sell a cash out refi to people with 600 credit. So I just sold what I could. I had to do what I could to survive even at the expense of the client because that’s what my leadership shoved down my throat. I worry to this day how many clients will inevitably file bankruptcy or foreclose due to horrible positions we put them into by “leveraging” their home. There is such a thing as over-leveraging. I drank the koolaid I was ra-ra but I didn’t realize how much of a cult this place was until I left. I feel like I’ve been beaten and brutalized by an abusive partner and just when I was ready to leave things got a little bit better for a short period of time. But they’ll resort back to their old ways. It’s who they are and who they’ve always been. This place has ruined marriages, created absentees parents, destroyed physical and mental health of its team members. It is hands down the worst place to work in the country. (Oh we won awards though - do you not remember being outright told to fill out the “anonymous” surveys with exactly what they wanted you to say to “buy” the accolade) Save yourself, get out while you can. And if you’re considering working here prepare to check your morales at the door because your soul can’t bear to be responsible for expense of Jay Farner making multi-millions a year while you bust 60 hour weeks questioning your morals and values to make below minimum wage once the direct deposit hits. It’s a scam and I can’t wait to watch this RKT crash in exchange for all the emotional damage it’s caused all of us.",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread

13,"Friendly Reminder for everyone as I stay active here on this depressing page …if you currently are in foundation, after you pass your exam and get your licenses, go ahead and move to another company if you REALLY want to stay in mortgages. Even in this crummy economy. I know AT LEAST a dozen who left Rocket, and found their way into another position with another company. Trust me, those places know how miserable Rocket is, and won’t care if you spent only a few months there. They also know training from Rocket is “top tier”.  More than likely, you are intelligent with a lot of skill to offer. Realtors, Clients, and employees of Rocket are miserable working with and for this company. Why do you think they went from Quicken Loans to Rocket Mortgage? Like Scooby Doo, take the monsters mask off.. “Quicken Loans?!?” “I woulda gotten away with it if it wasn’t for logic and common sense”Take care of your mental health, and realize you are more than a Number, or a cog in a machine. Your personal time be it with yourself, with family or whatever is important. As is your dignity. 
There’s so many other mortgage companies out there that will take care of you. Unlike here, where it’s nothing but brainwashed individuals who are trapped in a cult mindset (pls pray for them), the air is constantly tense with lies and that gut feeling we all are doing the wrong thing, and leaders who are trapped with huge car payments with a company that doesn’t care about them. Thus, they do upper leaderships bidding, and have a hard time stepping up and defending their team. Which makes things worse. “Americas Largest Lender” fits in with Americas Largest heavy hitters, like McDonald’s, or think of Walmart, Wells Fargo, Amazon etc. They Destroy everything in their path, shit on everyone, and suck up money like no other, while pretending to be some savior to both clients and their employees. Just another wolf in sheep clothing. 
Don’t think “Largest Lender” is something to boast about either, corporate greed and incompetence is what it is. Only straight fools stay here, and validate the lie. You validate the lie for this massive company who continue to make huge profits, while the economy tanks and the majority of her bankers, including regular Americans suffer and struggle. Use Rocket like they use everyone else. Get your license’s and then get out as soon as you can, and spread the word of this ass backwards company.

Client did not want to move forward understandably, rate also goes from a 3.5 to a 6%, payment shoots up $400, on a home value $65k more than what it was August 2021…and my director said it’s my fault I didn’t close as the loan “makes perfect sense”.

*Edit: Director is going to call her himself, and explain that the $13k in closing costs is “No Big Deal” as we roll them in, and we can refinance them again when rates go down, ignoring the fact they will once again incur more of rockets closing costs, AND no doubt a lesser home value…SEND HELP NOW SOS SOS SOS WE ARE SINKING PREDATORY LENDER ALERT!!!**Update on situation: Director called client again, explained in a sleezy way that we have a “Loan Tracking Team” and to not worry about the closing costs, focus on the credit card debts and removing the ‘burden’…

23," Compensation for Jay Farner, who will retire from the company effective June 1, was $9.469 million in 2022, up from $1.603 million, according to the company's annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this week.

27,"*long post, but worth the read*I started working for RKT 3 years ago, I busted my ass to pass SAFE with the promise of making 6 figures, opportunity to be promoted quickly, and working for the “best” mortgage company. Note: I was aware of the hours, and willing to sacrifice and work hard to be successful here.Here is what you can ACTUALLY expect as a banker at RKT:1. Most of the people in leadership are just a bunch of over paid, under educated hype men. They sit on their asses all day, clap, yell and shove bullshit down your throat about how great this opportunity to bank at Rocket Mortgage is, and how we should feel so lucky. All to feed their own egos and grow their bank accounts. If Ieadership is reading this, I challenge you to do what you ask of us everyday, get on the phone and “dig deep”/try to sell a bullshit loan to a very pissed off client we’re reaching out to for the 6th time in 2 days. 2. The opportunity to make good money here is only for certain people. I went from writing 60+ loans a month, to an average of 3-5 for the last 6 months. Meanwhile, newer bankers with little to no sales skill are exceeding goal. Lead flow is so poorly distributed it’s almost comical. Unless you’re a brand new banker (who they’re trying to keep from quitting right away, you know, for retention purposes) or one of the kool-aid drinkers receiving platinum leadflow, you will spend your days trying to convince a client with a 2.25% that a 6.75% makes more sense for them. Oh, and my favorite part is having a regional huddle every single day to congratulate and cheer for the people lucky enough to get a fighting chance to make money here. The ones “showing everyone else what’s possible”. 3. This company couldn’t care less about its team members. Most of us have been making less than minimum wage for the past 6-8 months. Not only does it cost me more than I’m making to fill up my gas tank to drive into the office 4+ days a week, but it’s getting tough to pay bills. Don’t worry though! The higher ups are still making hundreds of millions off of us little minions, and don’t care to share the wealth. 4. I was lied to and screwed over with not one, but TWO different promotions, not one person in leadership is honest or transparent about ANYTHING.5. I was forced to work weekends, and once cancelled a trip because my DMB wouldn’t let me take a weekend off. There is ZERO work/life balance. You either sell your soul to the devil to be “successful” or you choose your mental health. It’s a rule of thumb that your DMB won’t let you spend time with family/friends, or take care of yourself without making you feel guilty and unworthy of success first. 6. They preach about the ISMS, but don’t live them. There are so many shady leaders/bankers working here. “DTRT” truly means nothing when this organization has bankers pulling a client’s credit without permission, taking leads right out of another banker’s name, and encouraging (forcing) us to call our clients 3+ times a day for several weeks just to leave the same voicemail or try and bully them into a loan that financially f*cks them.7. They change and move our teams/specialties constantly, which is inevitable with a large company, but they will know of these changes for months/weeks, and let us know the day before they are taking place. 8. Emails and meetings from/with the higher ups are nothing but a bunch of fake hype and stories about overcoming adversity and hard times. I wish more people would open their eyes to the bullshit and stop feeling obligated to be “thankful” that this company is doing the bare minimum to support their employees during these tough times. ESPECIALLY when they are still only worried about the company making money, and have worked us down to the bone for the last 2 years.9. You won’t ever feel job security, you are constantly threatened to be demoted, put on letter or separated from the company. Not meeting goal because you aren’t putting in the effort is one thing, but having a goal of 20+ in this market and an unrealistic expectation to hit that otherwise you’ll be fired, is ridiculous.10. Lastly, if I never have to hear “it’s your mindset”, “did you ask about assets?”, “2 same days and you get to leave at 5 on Friday!”, “7 credits and we’ll put you on the wheel to win amaze points” or “there are some changes in place, it’ll get better” ever again, I’ll be thrilled. I will give them this though, they are good at sales, and making bankers feel like they won’t survive or be successful outside of Rocket Mortgage. Here’s one thing I’ve learned, you aren’t a failure if you leave, despite how often they make it their priority to make you feel that way. If you’re feeling stuck working for this glorified frat house, there are so many careers where you will be paid well, valued, and successful! This is your sign to get out of the toxic relationship with RKT.",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread

29,"I've been gone from RKT for a few months and am just now starting to feel like a human being again. I didn't remember what it was like to spend time with my family or have a full weekend off. I truly felt crushed under the weight of the constant micro management and criticism.  I did well for a long time there, but the hours prevented me from spending time with my family.  I would wake up, work, sleep, repeat 6 days a week. I left the mortgage industry for now. Being the sole provider for my family, when sh*t got sh*tty I knew I needed a steady income. I truly hope those still there can find success,  but don't ever let the kool-aid sour in your stomach. You can find success outside of RKT. You are not a failure if you leave. The core of the industry is to help people. Working at a company that doesn't help their own people or their clients for that matter will eat at your soul. Make a plan, to get out, to put yourself first, to put your family first. I'm a much happier person now that I'm gone and not having the kool-aid being forced down my throat 70+ hours a week.

31,"Hello All,
Former TC banker here was at Rkt for almost 9 years just left within the last couple weeks. I can tell u the grass is truly greener on the other side. After working every specialty in the company i can tell you refi is dead. Rkt pricing is shit, the fact theyre calling all of our current clients we refinanced in 2020 when rates were 1.99 -3% and wanting us to convince them that refinancing into a 6-7% makes sense to pay off debt is a joke. They have completely ruined their reputation with all their current clients and i can guarantee you when rates do eventually drop down (could be years from now) theyll lose a huge percentage of their market share because their clients no longer feel like Rocket has their best interest in mind. I cant even tell you how many cari clients told me they are going to leave RKT asap due to the non stop phone calls just to pitch them a 6%+ clients were straight up telling bankers that we are desperate and trying to screw them over which i 100% agree with. I cant sell something i wouldnt do myself, so when the client says no and u cant justify the savings the conversation is over, and telling clients “well refinance you 6 months to a year from now when rates go back down” is completely misleading and idk how theyre getting away with this because the chances if rates being lower 6 months from now is highly unlikely.I used to love working for RKT from 2013 up until this year but it was having a major impact on my mental health working 60 hours a week, signing up for almost every weekend because we need to “refinance them now because in a few months it wont be a 6% its going to be 8% as if any half intelligent home owner would refinance from their sub 3% rate to a 6% to pay off their debt, and to top it off even though we offer HELOCs we would have to convince the client with whatever bullshit line they gave us for the day that HELOCS are bad and to stay away. A HELOC makes much more financial sense for anyone with a sub par 3% rate on their primary mortgage if they wanna pay off debt but lets hide this from the client. RKT HAS LOST ALL INTEGRITY. Their new ism is “fuck every client every time, no excuses no exceptions” over the last month iv had more than 10 interviews with other institutions for banking, which many offered atleast 2x the salary RKT paid + commission which was substantially more because they pay based on BPS. Also took a job for another financial institution (which im not going to name) the hours are 9-5 2 days in office 3 from home mon - friday no weekends. The salary alone is enough to live on. After being with the company so long i did reach out to leadership to see if i could switch to a diff specialty bc i can do refi and purchase n they wernt willing to work with me, RKT doesnt give a fuck about you, take your licenses and go else where. Banks are hiring like crazy right now, for the amount of hours theyre making you work right now my average was coming out to minimum wage because goals are way too high in this market, atleast for triple crown bankers. Idk anyone that was making decent money or crushing goal every month, i know there are a select few maybe still hitting goal but you need to see the writing on the wall, refi gravy train is over. I still cant understand how theyre not being sued or audited for their misleading practices. I loved my coworkers and my leaders but i couldnt put up with the shady shit the company is doing now. If your not happy start applying to other places, you will see other institutions love rkt bankers. Dont risk ur mental health, i made a TON of money their but at the end of the day i was miserable in the end. Best of luck everyone, feel free to reach out and message me if i can help you in anyway. Best of luck yall!",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread
32,"I woke up and decided “I am not doing this today.” My mental health has deteriorated so much so that my psychiatrist was begging me to quit OR get back on meds. My family hasn’t really seen me in months either. It’s like when I am with them or trying to get away from work, work was always on my mind and it could show in our time together. I made the decision that I am not putting myself on the back burner anymore for a company who doesn’t even care if I can make my mortgage payments. Anyways, my first step was submitting a resignation letter and my partner did that for me around 3 a.m. since I have crippling anxiety, thanks Rocket. On the bright side, I feel as if an elephant is no longer stepping all over me and I can breathe. I’m going to sleep in, go to the gym and take my sweet time. I’m going to go to the grocery store and go sit at the park because I can do that. I cannot wait for the emails and messages to stop as I am always triggered with panic attacks when that happens. Im so excited to see how my mental health improves in the foreseeable future without RKT. Jobs come and go but time is something we’ll never get back. I refuse to waste anymore time doing things that were crushing my soul. Peace & love to all, especially those struggling to make a decision.

35,"Attention aviators, new dev, blueprint bankers:Hi.  Take it from an old man like myself, you’re being lied to. Re: leads…
There are too few qualified clients coming in to have even 40% of the banking force hit goal. Note, I said coming in, assuming 100% of qualified clients that are allocated closed, fewer than 40% of you would hit goal. Understand that the industry standard payout for loan originators is 1% of the loan amount. LOs typically have to self-gen leads, make real relationships to bring in business. Rocket’s business model is based on being spoon-fed leads of varying quality, and therefore pays out, 0.4% at best(hit goal every month and have all clean-closing multipliers applied), and 0.2% more commonly. That’s 1/5 of 1%. 
In other words, close $75,000,000 of loan volume in a year to earn $150k. That’s 25 loans per month. Goal has lowered and adjusted these numbers down, slightly, but not by much. So if bankers at Rocket are meant to self-generate leads from here on, industry standard is at least 1% of the loan amount. Is that what you’re getting paid?Re: lead pools…
There are too few leads to allocate by pools properly, and too many bankers auto’d in for you to get high-converting, qualified leads. I can pretty safely bet that nobody on this thread understands how lead pools work. With that said, RVPs were once given “golden tickets”, which put their favorite banker or two into nothing but diamond-grade app calls. These are the bankers that you are made to applaud. Make no mistake, they are good at what they do, but often earned golden tickets by manipulating clients into marginally beneficial loans. Understand that their golden ticket gave them a fast track to promotion and a permanent place in top-tier leads. You are not one of them, and will not become one. RVPs are demoted and there are no more tickets to go around. Understand that you missed the boat by several years. Re: leadership…
Leaders, shame on you. Dishonest, manipulative, unfaithful, heartless, green-barring rats, every one of you. Countless meetings about tough times and a bountiful “war chest.” You’ve made us lie to our clients about “$3,000 in cost not mattering, because that’s only a few dollars in your payment” when you know they’ll come back in a year to refinance at “little to no cost”, stripping them further if equity, about failing to offer the best loan products (HELOC). 
Worst of all, you lied to us about us. You sell fresh 20 year old children on a dream of being a business owner, when you know that 85% will be forced to quit within the first 18 months. You lie about mindset, about DTRT (we know you miss the golden age of fast talking and green barring). 
You lie about opportunity when you know Rocket Logic is meant to replace top tenured bankers. Senior leaders have decided:
Why pay someone $25,000+ a month when you could demote everyone and pay a director less than $12k and 15 bankers minimum wage at $1,500 a month at a combined $35k for the team? Great business sense, but it’s clear that this plan is not working. Leads aren’t converting. Leaders lead? No, leaders left, and the dog pile is all that remains. In a failing business, the top contributors leave first, because they know better. You are trained poorly on guidelines and the market. Rates aren’t all the same, our pricing is outrageous, and most of what you’ve been told is simply not true. Directors are just bankers that didn’t leave. The directors are often good people, but are just as misinformed, trained to an extremely limited and uninformed scope about what’s real, and are panicking, parroting “mindset is all that matters”, drunk on the pretense that the men at the top will save them.  Leaders have lost the respect of the banking force, and that’s fine with them. Again, bankers are disposable. Loans produce an average of $6,000+ in immediate revenue when sold as MBS. The goal is clearly to phase people out. To bleed us dry so we leave voluntarily and are no longer entitled to severance or unemployment. 
The goal is to make you quit and hire in entry level call center workers. With Rocket Logic, Rock Connections will become the new banking force. Team, the market will not get better for at least another year or two. Leadership has failed you. Unless you want to continue this pattern, waking up at 35 with no way out, no transferable skills, yelling “mindset” at an empty wallet and hungry child, it’s time to leave. You think leaving is hard now? Imagine being 35 in the same position.

42,"Can’t believe I’m posting here after lurking for the past year never thought I’d be this guy😂. I was just terminated today, unable to beat my opportunity letter within the set period of time, thought RKT said we were going to “get through this together” but I was dead wrong. They put me, my pregnant wife, and three kids out on the street right before Christmas. I was a triple crown solution consultant and I was not offered a move back to banking or a demotion, this was my first production related offense during my 7 year stay here. During the final year of my employment the company was using my talents to stop highly qualified clients from backing out after they requested to withdraw. At times I was “selling” currently serviced clients on increasing their 2.75 rate to 6.99+ in order to consolidate small debts or take out small amounts of cash, it’s not an honorable way to make a living but I still did it with my head down. Looking back I knew this was  unethical and using my skills to persuade people into bad financial decisions is the devils work, no different than strippers trading morals for cash. Our pay was first cut in half, then cut to a quarter, then our RVP created a entirely new role (SA) to disrupt and eliminate the SC role all together (it’s an SC with no licenses and no skills who calls once then denies). He pitched this to us as an opportunity to work on more difficult loan solutions as a reward for all our efforts, in the end his cute idea ended up destroying our income, business, and eventually our jobs. If you are currently in SpaceX, prepare yourself for launch 😂😂😂 and I mean that literally For those who know me you know I was one of the most notorious UPS folder mailers in RKT history and also an occasional notary/Uber driver 😉. I was an aggressive banker who made a ton of money here for both myself and the company and I loved every minute of it. I loved this place and was fully bought in the entire time I was here even up to my termination. I had no complaints about the hours or anything, I enjoyed the challenge. I was led to believe this could be a lifelong career and I truly believed it. So here’s my advice to anyone on the edge or on “opportunity/acceleration” letter; get a head start and make real plans to leave now, get your job interviews taken care of on RKT company time, save your paystub/w2s on workday, save personal docs and email them to yourself, do not be afraid to use your PTO since they only pay 120 hours when you leave, do not be afraid to say no to team outings or “cordially required” events, do not be afraid to ditch teams meetings or any other meeting you deem unnecessary. Fault for lack of production will ALWAYS be placed on you and never the market conditions, you will forever be at the mercy of your leaders opinion of your efforts. The company is looking release staff without any mainstream news of layoffs, and they’re doing this by actively allowing you to earn a very small amount hoping you voluntarily leave, aka attrition. Once the market gets better “goals” will be increased at which time you will have spent a year or more waiting for the light at the end of the tunnel while earning less than your average waitress. You will then be asked to write 20 loans, 30 loans, 40 loans, just to get your “base pay”. Base pay is a number pulled from the sky to ensure you don’t earn too much in good markets, it is NOT used to ensure you earn enough in bad markets. The better the market conditions are, the more work you must do to earn the same base amount. The company has been deliberately stealing from us this whole time and no one had the heart to stand up and say something, including me. I was at a triple crown offsite meeting a few weeks ago and you couldn’t even tell there was any market concern, everyone walking around laughing and giggling as if rates were still 2%. Quoting mr bill “they don’t even know they’re dead yet” lol. Saying the quiet part out loud; there are TMs currently earning $100, $500, $1000, in compensation for an entire month of work, this is laughable. How will they pay their mortgage? How will they pay their car note? How will they put food on the table? How will their credit report pass licensing next year? These are questions the company has no concern for, auto-in and shut your mouth says the culture. The entire time I worked here I was always told the classic story of the legendary “war chest” which would be unleashed during hard times, or the heroic tale of how we would “gobble up market share” when other lenders were closing up shop. I can confidently say neither of these are true. The war chest does not exist for your benefit and the market share percentage is irrelevant when TMs aren’t earning any money. There was a time where the company cared about the bankers and made decisions that reflected that. Once the company went public those kind of decisions ended. The man who lead us to success is no longer at the wheel of this company and the decisions being made are by top tier koolaid drinkers like the bald boomski guy. If you are wondering if the company is going to “make it right” or “do right by us” this holiday season, don’t hold your breath I can confirm there is a 0% chance. Maybe you’ll get a Shinola watch but you don’t even deserve that!! Many times I was amongst the top earners and highest converters in the entire company but was still released without subjectivity. This maneuver will become the norm, and over the next 24 months you will watch as highly decorated and tenured team members are ruthlessly terminated, and when the dust settles you will be surrounded by newer uninformed employees who can afford to earn 30-50k annually and have no idea what bps are. The employees who made the company such an awesome place to be are being deserted one by one, and soon all that will be left are entry level recruits who read the script and fall in line, harass their clients by calling 5 times a day, advise their clients on agreeing to poor financial decisions, in other words team members who *simply don’t care*. They will be here for a small paycheck and nothing more. okay I’m done ranting but I’ll be back for more I’ve got plenty of time on my hands now…",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread

46,"Heyyyy, friends (IYKYK). I have been creeping here for a bit and I know I jumped on a post the other day but I did just want to come here and say I AM SORRY. Listen, I started with Rocket as a banker myself and it was the WORST time of my life. I mean honestly, I had my psychiatrist BEGGING me to quit at every appointment. I gained nearly 100 lbs in my first year between the depression and not leaving my desk. I missed time with my kids to the point where I honestly would go days with having only a short conversation or two with them, and all because some lowlife man sat on a zoom call and said it wasn’t about a work life balance; it’s just life and work is a part of life.I made excuses for myself, I convinced myself it was normal, I defended the company to family and friends who were seriously concerned about me. I started to think, maybe it’s just me. Yeah this job could be life changing and great for someone in their early 20s who doesn’t have a family… yada yada. I was wrong. Rocket is not a good position for anyone. I truly believe unless you are a legit sociopath, there is no way it is not taking a toll on your mental health and well being. When I came to training I was actually planning on leaving the company, but I did love training and the material and thought maybe it would be different. I don’t know how I went from being a victim of the toxic culture, misogynism, etc, to being a part of selling it- and for that I am sorry. I hated having to keep up a brick wall and hide what the culture and banking really was. I hate that I sold the culture so heavily. I hate that I literally somehow became so brainwashed that I started brainwashing. I know I can’t name myself, but I still want to say it. And I still want all of you that I trained know that I really did and still do want the best for all of you. And please listen when I say YOU CAN LEAVE. You are not a horrible person for wanting to. You are not a quitter. You are not a person without work ethic. You are allowed to care about yourself and you deserve to be happy.

Terrible market conditions combined with 4 straight quarters of declining earnings. With any luck, an external CEO who isn't your typical Kool-Aid drinker steps in and helps move the organization in a positive way. My wish list for changes are as follows:  
1. Trust bankers to get the job done and cut costs in leadership. The amount of DMB's at Rocket aren't really needed and cost more than they provide in value. Offer the bottom 50% producing DMBs roles as Mortgage Bankers or get rid of them. Use the extra funds to boost the salaries of bankers, which is LONG overdue for a livable base salary.  
2. Overtime is unnecessary when the market is terrible. It's actually costing the company a lot more than it's worth. Cap the hours at 45 hours per week for all employees. Also pay the legal overtime rate to cut down on the lawsuits the company is facing.  
3. Allow every employee the option to WFH to cut down on operating costs and boost employee morale.Anyone have anything else to add for changes they want to see from a new CEO?",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread

Not to mention our clients? And don’t say it’s the market, that’s a lazy excuse and unfitting for a company like this, only straight baboons make that excuse. I just watched a coworker (and friend) of mine cry her eyes out because she got ripped into by her leadership this morning for not getting a deposit, when the client gave several objections mentioning how the new loan made literally zero financial sense to her. My coworker struggled to convince her otherwise, mind you she’s been here for a long time, she’s not new or inexperienced, and did not want to harm the client financially, or lie for that matter. So she gets RIPPED into, and we all imagine she will be an example for the next super high speed game film in front of everyone on her team. 
From what I understand, this client was in a really bad spot financially, had a credit just at 600, and couldn’t afford a brand new loan with high Rocket costs, high interest etc, only to pay off two credit cards that total $7,000. Closing costs were literally more then her credit debts. This client supposedly applied for government help online, and we called her, several times to a point of harassment, she (my coworker) gets on the phone, calms this lady down, after an unprofessional foundation transfer, convinces her to take a look at her finances all the way up to presenting the loan…with the director naturally listening in foaming at the mouth. You know the rest. This individual, my co worker and friend, deserves SO much better then this.

92,"Lol this is a great thread - Just to share my two cents, I worked for Rocket from Jan 2018 - April 2022, was a banker, senior banker, solution consultant, then a solution analyst. they fired me 2 days before offering leave/laying over 2,000 people off. They fired me solely to avoid paying me severance pay, I got nothing but a “best of luck” in regards to being a top performer. They claimed the reason for my termination was due to my communication, yet I had no issues with communication prior and treated all my clients/employee’s quiet well - I even won an award for every client every time, and was recognized for it frequently. I tried taking legal action but there was nothing my attorney said we could do (my attorney was from legal shield, a company that gets most of their business from Rocket employees). When I was working for them asa solution analyst, you were required to work a minimum of 24 loans daily. Everyday, we would run out of loans to work within the first 30 minutes to an hour, there was no way to meet expectations (the only way some people did was by pulling all 24 loans first thing in the morning, in which took all the leads from people who followed the rules of only working 1 loan at a time). When asking leadership how you can meet their expectations when they don’t provide you leads to meet their exceptions, their solution was specifically “Just try to work really fast and get your numbers”, almost word for word. Rocket is the most trash, manipulative, cuck cultivating, fuck their employees, fat bag of cocks I’ve ever worked for - I’m doing much better now so I don’t care as much, but I still find immense joy in seeing everyone slowly realize how piss poor of a company they are and I fully anticipate they will completely crash and burn in the near future with a mixture of how trash the housing market is right now along with nobody wanting to work for their shit eating leadership team.",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread

103,"Rocket did this to themselves. They were amazing when the market was good, pricey yes but that was to protect them when times got tough. Welp times got tough and they had to lay off close to 90 percent of ops, you'd think they'd levege those fees to keep costs lower to gain market share. Nope, they went the opposite direction, while at the same time lower commission goals for their banker force (and nothing about salary increases). It's clear Walters/tb/Farner are dumbing the job down so they can hire mlos at $15 an hour to click bottoms all day with barely any foundation, ops, uw, etc. The problem comes in that they no longer have crediabity or rankings to back their costs. They flew too close to the sun and got greedy. Now when the market improves, cari clients aren't refing with us cause why would they? Loan tracking went from improving your situation to harassment. Power clients clicked one button by accident and got blown up by us thousands of times. We lost our prestige and that makes a difference. Bankers going hungry and desperate in sales equals no sales and z suite doesn't care and even lowered the amount. 
It pains me to write this as I Loved quicken, middle management was amazing and even upper middle management too. I felt like the banking force was a gaint family. The hours were long sure but you were treated like you mattered and we're respected as a human and as a person. Once we went public, it became a numbers game and we lost our touch. The rocket flew too close to the sun. Is it savagable? Maybe but Gilbert NEEDS to clean house, go private again and aim smaller till we rebuilt what made this org amazing. Can't have a banking force, who is basically your only income stream, go hungry and be afaird of how they'll pay their bills. You can't abuse your cari clients and take them for granted.
Final thoughts I will always respect quicken and management that treated me well and part of the family and I WISH my path allowed me to stay for them. But when z suite saw us as a number on a spreadsheet you lose everything that made you amazing. I wish you the best rocket and I do hope to come back one day but the way things are going, I can't see me coming back anytime soon. Seize the low stock price and go private again. Clear house with your terrible z suite and bring people who care about l of us

116,"oh my oh my oh my. i've been holding back from commenting on this thread but have been reading it for a few weeks now. i wish i could share my resignation letter with you all cause it spoke so much truth. rockets largest issue is its inability to self reflect
then i'd say it's banking and marketing model stunt individual growth and networking. no one is ever going to spend time or money building their own clientele to just have it stripped away for unrealistic expectations. i haven't been there since march so i'm unsure if programs have changed but lola is a POS, her winking eyes haunt me. The follow up rules and escalation policy literally prevents bankers from being able to build real organic relationships. working at rocket gave me a better outlook on life and made me realize there isn't enough money in the world to deal with what they put people thru. HOWEVER, if they spent less on marketing, and compensated their employees appropriately they would have less turn over and a greater ROI per banker. Furthermore bankers would be able to grow organically and bring business to the company but in order to be able to do such a thing the company would need to able to reflect on their failing practices and since everyone is a yes man and afraid to speak up it's just a sinking ship. i very loudly expressed my opinions on tiktok about what rocket does and had my rvp reach out to me to try and tell me im going to regret speaking out, but i promise you guys i have 0 regrets. my old dmb was the most obnoxious and disrespectful person i've ever met in my life. he would talk shit about each of his bankers to other bankers and create drama out of his own ass. he one time referred to a banker i looked up to as mickey mouse cause she had a high pitched voice. this man had no respect for women or anyones personal time. text messages every single day at the break of dawn with 3 huddles a day were he just went on rants had to be the worst part of it. god this imbecile loved to hear him self speak. one time he jumped on a call and cut me off mid sentence, spoke over the client for 25 mins, went against everything she was asking for (cause he doesn't have any emotional intelligence) and just spoke to this women like she was dumb, she told me a few days later that if he hadn't interrupted our call that she'd had done business with me but she couldn't work with a company who employed a man like that. LET THAT SINK THE FUCK IN. to prevent him for being up my ass i played his ego right back to him with constant praise so that i wouldn't become a target for his abuse. i have so much family that works or worked there and knew that they would try to convince me to stay so i made it out to be like it was me not them uk, classic mind game on the mind fuckers themselves. Months after i quit i would get calls from my old team mates saying my dmb was bringing me up and saying weird ass shit that didn't even add up. i confronted him and his response was to not communicate with rocket team members like he's god or something and can dictate who people talk to when they are off work, don't worry i very boldly explained to him what a fucking moron he sounded like :) . i contemplated suing rkt and this man for harassment but i can care less about his miserable life and want nothing to do with the organization. karma is real and what goes around will come back around 10x over. god is great. anyway. at the end of the day nothing at rkt will change and unfortunately so long as people are scared to speak up they will continue to use deceptive and abusive practices to make money cause the only thing that company cares about is it's bottom dollar. they lead with fear and aggressive legal terminology that scares the young college graduates that they pray on for slave labor. that place is a sweat shop decorated like a college frat house. for anyone working there take advantage of their tuition reimbursement programs, the health care, your discount on a purchase, learn a few sales tricks and quit.oh and if trs or any site leader is reading this, GFY :) you are apart of the problem.",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread
117,"Finally got out from this toxic work environment and it feels so good to be free. I started in October and crushed the safe exam. Was promised a career making on average 75k a year easy and 6 figures in second year was common.  I bought in to it since I had never made even half of that amount at a job before. I believed everything I was being told and that I just needed to pay it forward in foundation's for a few months working 55 to 60 hours a week at 15 an hour but hell it was alteast paid OT. The market was still in a good spot and bankers were selling 2 and 3% rates at the time. I ended up november through February in foundations and finally hit the sales floor in  mid February.  And just as I get there they raise foundation pay to 20 bucks an hour  but keep us aviators at 15 but strip us of OT pay. I was salty at this time but figured atleast we get a commission floor of a grand and i could make even more if i do well. I've been running low on savings and in my head I really figured I just had to make it to end of April or may and I'll start to see some really big paychecks and know I've made it and that everything is going to be ok. Rocket will take care of me. March comes along and I kill it in aviators writing the most loans at 7 for an aviator. Unfortunately there was no big commission check yet. I won a trip to Miami that would come some day soon I'm told. Next month comes in April and the market really starts to fall apart. I write 1 loan and make 200 bucks, same 1 loan in May for less than 200bucks. And finally In June I find out our base pay is dropping to 10.50 an hour and I have no loans and no savings left. They take away our ability to pick up Mel's and save those for PC and tc bankers only. Then they take away our incoming calls and force us back on the blended dialer only to pay us half of what foundation makes and no OT but this BS retro ot that is nothing if you're not selling. They force overtime on us every weekend and if you don't stay late passed your regular 12 hour shift you're not bought in. They preach all these values and how rocket will take care of you but it's all lies and gaslighting. I had so little money left that I literally couldn't quit until I found a new job and the 500 dollar checks every 2 weeks were needed just so I could pay rent and buy food on credit cards. Meanwhile I'm expected to call clients who don't need our help and try to manipulate them into a loan that does not help them because they have some credit card debt and inflation is on the rise. Meanwhile this company that made 100s of billions the past years isn't adjusting our base pay a cent. It's absolutely sickening. I started calling off or making up that I had covid or doctors appointment or anything just to interview at home because the hybrid schedule I was promised was taken away before I could even enjoy it. I managed to land a job in mid July that doesn't start till beginning of August and found out this March madness trip to Miami that I won was July 21st to 24. I had to have meetings with my rvp and dmb asking me if I was all in or not and that they wanted to put me on letter for calling off so much. Luckily they didn't and I had to lie and say I was all in on rocket. Two long weeks of having to put on a face ans smile and dial but I got one over on this fucked up company. I went to Miami on rocket this past weekend. Stayed at a fancy hotel with all the higher ups. Ate dinner across from Jason pace and these execs as they chuckled not with a care in the world aabout how bad this company fucked over so many people while they play golf, rent Lamborghinis, and buy expensive steak dinners. I landed Sunday night. And wrote up my resignation letter Monday morning and emailed it to my rvp and dmb. Damn did that feel good. And from what I hear of bankers that work their still he was pissed that I got one over on them.  And now knowing my next job is no weekends ever regular business hours and fully remote I can see how truly fucked a company rocket is for not allowing any work life balance and preaching how great they are. It's all a lie. And I made it out. With no money and some debt on my credit cards but I feel more free right now then I have in the past 9 months. If you're still there get out. It's not worth the hours, the missed family events, and the constant stress. The money might be good in a low rate environment but they will bleed you dry well before you can even get there and blame you for not working harder and longer hours.

Just wanna say that Rocket Mortgage, in all honesty, is a sad, depressing and miserable place to be..one only needs to take the time, and read through this incredible Reddit page to get a glimpse of what makes this company an absolute NIGHTMARE! Most are TERRIFIED to speak out. Well I’m here to tell you not to be…Leaders like Jason Pace and all the other ones in the CLE site are nothing but hacks, losers, liars, crooks, and deceptive tool bags. I’d imagine it’s the same in Detroit, as well as in Phoenix. The amount of DEPRESSION that’s in the office today, every day, is PALPABLE. No one is happy here, everyone hates it, everyone is terrified of their futures…be it tenured or brand new. The hope of making a great career at “Americas Largest Lender” is squashed every day, and you are literally psychologically screwed on the daily..and we have to screw our clients into mortgages that make ZERO sense for them..that is, if they can even stay on the phone with us much past 60 seconds, without getting annoyed or anxious due to our shitty, lame, cliché and over all cringe scripts that anyone with an operating brain in their skull, can see it’s robotic and deceptive. Again, this Reddit page breaks down much of what’s going on. I encourage you, if you read all of this stuff in silence, PLEASE don’t be scared to stand up..voice your experience with Rocket on this page..don’t be scared to step up..many are feeling just like you!!If you are stuck here and feel alone, don’t worry…you’re not alone.

153,"Well, I’m waiting for my boxes to arrive to ship back my equipment. I was put on letter in May, and missed my letter goal by 1.2 loans and this is my story.I started with Rocket in November of 2021. I passed safe the first time, got through foundation, had purchase focused training, and a month of aviator before a 16 week maternity leave. I returned from maternity leave August 2022. From there I completed the remainder of my time in aviator(remind you for purchase) and October 1 I hit the banking floor in LS working BOTH purchase and refinance leads in the most difficult lead pool. I did earn a folder coin my first month. October-December I was with one director, then this director separated from the company. I was then moved to another director, in the same specialty for 2 months before this director stepped down into a banking role. Director #3 was my director for 4 months; March through the end of June, then they too stepped into a banking role. My team was moved to Cari Refi from LS starting May 1. This was a completely new specialty to all, including our director. I don’t want to forget to mention that amidst the move from one specialty to the other, we left LOLA and started OH. “Hey you’re moving to Cari it’s gonna be so great, you’re gonna close 20 loans a month going to the easiest specialty since you’re in the hardest one right now. You need to learn a new software, here’s your opportunity letter and you need to write 16 loans to keep your job.”My opportunity letter stated that they would provide extra support and training to help me reach my goals which was quite the opposite of what I received. I’d sent messages to my SVP and never once got a reply until Wednesday when asked “hey, are you available for a call?”. I’m salty, but I know this is best for me now. I’m salty because my folder goal was 16. I’ve never wrote 8 loans in a month. At best, 6…remember that closing coin? I should not have been on letter. I missed that bottom % by 1 closing. That one closing was delayed on a day that I was OOO and UW requested a doc about the clients bank merging with another bank. Are you kidding me? It’s public knowledge. I’m convinced that this is part of the process now that it’s closing model….Push loans into the next month to mess with the banker tiers, and get letters disbursed instead of calling it layoffs. I’m a mother of 2 and my husband is in the service. He was away at annual training for 3 weeks during my time on letter. It’s not fair. Rocket doesn’t care about their team members, let alone their veterans and veteran spouses. I’m on a rant at this point and have one more statement to make. I was completely baffled that with my separation confirmation email it references “employment agreement” several times when talking about you can’t do this and you can’t do that. So, I emailed back asking for a copy. I had to fill out a request form for my own employment agreement. This should be included in the separation email from the start. The employment agreement should also be titled “team member agreement” because I thought we were not suppose to call ourselves employees cause we’re a team? Thanks all for listening.

154,"First time poster long term lurker, I finally quit last month after 3 years at Rocket. Surprisingly held on a lot longer than I thought I would, as I’ve never worked for such a toxic company. I won’t lie and say I didn’t do well financially (no where close to what they say is possible). Though I did make 6 figures back in 2022 and it kept me going and being a slave. Plus being remote and making 6 figures was a dream for me but I finally quit the week I had 3 closing as I couldn’t hold on for any amount of money any longer. (Friends say I should have quit after the closings but I couldn’t stand one more minute)Every one I started with was either fired or quit and the wrong people were made dmb’s. I had to show my DMB how to do loans so often that I did his job on top of mine. I honestly don’t even want to be a banker anymore Atleast for the foreseeable future, if anyone has any remote job suggestions please shoot me a message. I dream of a brain dead customer service job at this point I don’t think I can mentally take on another commission based career right now. Last I saw people were involved with a lawsuit about overtime I believe (I won’t be joining) but curious how did that turn out? I saw it as a losing case but you never know, guess I just like to hear a story of Rocket getting fucked over ha. Thanks for reading my little rant, wish you all the best in your career and a balance between work and life.

That the work we do is what drives the growth of the cities we occupy and all the other businesses that suckle off our hard work.  Yet why do we feel so unappreciated?  Why do I feel like I’m being pushed out the door when I’m being told by senior leadership to “go all in,” when you can have two bad months and they can’t push you out the door fast enough.  It’s such a terrible business model.  They realize every employee they shit on they are just creating a competitor or somebody that will deter them from working with Rocket Mortgage.  We have a reputation for being overpriced and the bankers to be inexperienced and senior leadership seems committed to keeping it this way.  I guess they will say it has worked for over 40 years so why try to make it better.  They aren’t obsessed with finding a better way.

156,"I joined RKT mid 21 and left about a month ago. I was so ecstatic to join RKT because its systems work, they have top tier training, and theres no better place to be than the big ship if there is a turbulent market right?I started on the phones in Oct and did well until about February. The commissions are tier based. You are supposed to get $250 per loan but because it is tier based, you dont even make $1k until you get 7 loans. but if you get 15 loans all of a sudden you are making $5k which is ""great"".It really started to fall apart in April. Every single lead I got was annoyed we are calling them, they have asked to be opted out, they just refinanced, they were looking for the stimmy, etcI have come to the conclusion that RKT is a cult. The ISMS are just a way for leadership to point at them and say see ""we are the they"" ""get back on the phones and help these people""They want you to work 55 hours a week minimum which doesnt sound bad until you only have 1 day off a week and you are working from 8am to 7pm M-F at a minimum making only $2k a month because noone wants to refi anymore. This company is designed to do extremely well in a booming market. In this market, a real mortgage company is going to succeed because they are able to help those with extenuating circumstances. This work life balance is awful, their micromanagement is on another level, and their ability to make you feel like crap is incredible.

212,"I quit last week. Their SAFE training is definitely top tier and they really sell you on how great the company is, but saw some red flags as far as how hard they push the ""ISMs"" on you and how many of the SAFE trainers and people in other departments that they have come speak to us for motivation were only bankers for the absolute minimum amount of time before they could transfer to a different department, while preaching how great banking is. Foundation was okay, I was only there for about a month. When I was in Foundation, the expectation was 1,000 dials and 40 transfers, but as business started slowing down, the expectation dropped to 800 dials and 30 transfers. It was easy but braindead work. I almost quit at this point because my FND director would host terrible 'game films' and humiliate us for not ARPing the client good enough to get them to a banker. I would only do clean transfers -- if the client was screaming or upset, or their dog or family member just passed away and they tell me I can F off, I wouldn't transfer them unless they seemed genuinely interested or at least willing to hear us out and speak with a banker, but the expectation was if you hear a human voice, you transfer. Initially we were trained to confirm the state they're looking to purchase in, but was told to stop confirming the state because it leaves room for objections and just transfer them anyways, and hope the banker is licensed in the correct state, otherwise they can transfer them to someone who is.I did well banking. Unfortunately I got put in refinance. In the beginning, you only get remarketing leads. All of the people I spoke to had submitted their information over a year ago and already refinanced into a 2% rate. Regardless, my lead-to-credit was still on average 30%-40% pushing free mortgage reviews, most people having little to no debt. 90% of my presentations made no sense (""Hey client, I know you said you did NOT want cash out and were only interested in a lower payment, and you have tons of assets, but let me show you what taking cash out looks like at a 5.25% from your 2.25% and your payment goes up $800""). Most of the loans I priced out in my final couple of months had no real tangible benefit and felt genuinely bad or scummy presenting bad loans. We weren't allowed to 'best spot' clients as there was ALWAYS an angle to sell, if you sell them hard enough on it. A lot of leads were senior citizens looking for a stimulus payout. The final couple of months, most of my leads being transferred to me were opt-out requests and HUDTs. We keep all leads in our pipeline for about a month, and even if the client decides after the presentation that the loan doesn't make sense to them and wasn't what they asked for, we are required to follow up 3x a day until they request to be opted out and continue to try and sell them on it.The recent changes made me realize now is not the time to work for Rocket, and maybe in the industry in general. The new hours became 7am to 8pm (good luck if you have to commute) with 6 days a week mandatory (even if you are pacing for goal, you will be working every single weekend) averaging about 65-70 hours a week. Weekends are now in office. You get shamed for stepping away to take a lunch and they purposefully schedule mandatory meetings, huddles, hot seats, and game films all throughout the day, every day, so there is no good time to take a lunch. Speaking of meetings, there's too many. There's even meetings ABOUT meetings. Lots of Rock Partners and higher-ups preaching to bankers about how great the company is, the market ebbs and flows, and if you stick with it, you will be able to retire in 10 years. You will get told by seniority, ""when I started years ago, I was selling rates at 6% so you can too!"" without mentioning that rates have never been as low as they were in 2020/2021 and without them working in a market coming up from those low rates. Historically, that 6%+ was the norm, so of course it was sellable. Between the constant changes, lay offs, directors being demoted, and schedule changes forcing people out, the future of working here seemed bleak. It is very fraternity like, there is tons of nepotism. The majority of the work force is very young people as Rocket will hire anybody with a pulse, and I believe they find success in exploiting young kids who don't know any better with the promise of making 5-digits a month. They tell us the lowered goals are more beneficial for us, but with the lower pay per unit and goals still being unattainable, it just seems like a pay cut. I get paid $12/hour and if I hit goal, that earns me about $3,000 in commission.I'm not sure what I'm going to do next, but I'm going to enjoy some much-needed time off to catch up on sleep and relaxation.",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread
213,"Hello everyone, finally left a few days ago and it literally feels amazing. I can finally shed some light on what makes my experience at Rocket horrible to say the least.1) one of the biggest issues for me is how hard they go to keep everyone out of the loop when it comes to the pay. I’ve asked so many times ever since I got hired and all they do is pivot to something else. “ ask your director when you get there” or “our focus right now is this, we’ll worry about that later”.  So everyone during training up until banking rarely knows how the pay structure works as it is done on purpose to avoid people realizing how little they will be making when they rely on commissions. It was a shock to everyone when we all found out our pay was gonna drop to 10$ an hour and Half pay for overtime (5$). With mandatory overtime you’re working for 65-70 hours a week for basically nothing lmao 300$ dollars a week2) Another huge issue for me is how they paint a picture for everyone about “financial freedom” and constantly talk about what you’re gonna do when you get that 10k plus check blah blah blah when in reality only a small percentage of bankers are making money to stay afloat. I was able to get some information from bankers that had been there for years and were ready to pack it up and leave due to Rocket cutting commissions everywhere they could. With the market being the way it is, leads were cut by more than half and the remainder are people who have been recycled back into the system and have been harassed for months. Super dishonest but hey DTRT lol The bankers in the floor painted a totally different picture that shows the total opposite of what they tell everyone. I feel horrible knowing that there’s many great people that genuinely care about the company that will be devastated when they find out they have been misled the whole time. 3) “The ISMS” are another big issue for me. They tell you to “Do the right thing, every client every time, Ignore the noise” but in the same breath they want you to harass old leads of people who are fed up with being called 3-5 times a day and preying on older people who signed up for a stimulus or assistance, how in the hell is that doing the right thing? They cherry pick what works for them and pretend like everything else doesn’t matter. At the end of the day it’s scummy to be treating clients like that and acting like we do nothing wrong. It is unethical asf regardless of how you justify it. For everyone still at rocket keep your own interests first because let me tell you Rocket is only looking out for itself and won’t hesitate to back stab anyone that doesn’t fall in line.

226,Well let’s get started and let the truth come out. First thing yes this is a cult that especially preys on young people to work all hours of the day everyday and make them believe that it’s nothing else out there but this. I’m over 30 so I been around the block a couple of times with corporate America. I understand the bullshit they throw at us but Rocket is a little different. They will make you feel bad for breathing if your off the phone for 2 mins your getting a message from middle management. Off the phone for 5-10min then you might get put on letter shit it’s that serious no breaks we’re missing opportunity they will tell you such bullshit. They want all employees to have there head down work to 11pm if they can get that out of you have no opinion because it doesn’t matter. They want you to work long hours with little pay especially since the market has increased they still keep prices high and expect you to sell like it’s still 2020 or 2021. Since money is slow around there they need people to quit and since people aren’t doing it fast enough their firing you for the smallest shit. I understand saving your portfolio but should of thought about that when times were good you failed to realize good times also brings bad times in our economy. I’m leaving Rocket did about 3 years came there for a reason back in 2020 and I have accomplished that but now it’s hell on downtown. UWM has taken Q3 and now is the number 1 lender in America and when Rocket found that out they crack the whip even harder talking about getting in your feelings. When we have our regional meetings you can feel the energy that they are worried but for sure they will make it seem their fine and I understand why but don’t hype us up then in conclusion say if you don’t comply you will be fired wtf. The highest pricing lender in America I think it’s time to lower prices should of never went public because the value of the share is a shit show. RKT to the moon my ass we loose to many clients to overprice closing cost 7.5 for 15k are you serious wow. In conclusion I wouldn’t recommend this job to my family or friend they ask that question every time we have a survey and it always gets the lowest score and they wonder why.

227,"Just a reminder that RKT doesn't care about committing wage theft. They did it years ago by not paying bankers overtime by misclassifying the flsa status for the role as salary. And since then they've been stealing by once again misclassifying. They are using a little obscure rule for ""fluctuating workweek"" to get around paying the 1.5x overtime rate. The only issue with that, is that it requires employees paid this way to actually have fluctuating workweeks. So, regularly have weeks below 40 hours and regularly have weeks above 40 hours.

This is only true when the market is GOOD. When it is poor very few will hit and this proves very profitable for Rocket as if you only sell a couple loans a month you'll make around minimum wage and they'll rake in potentially your years salary. - Rocket has not raised its pay for bankers (commission wise) since 2019 at least, in fact when the market was good goals went up. So yes it was easier to sell loans but it's not as if they were making less on each loan. In fact since housing values went up double to quadruple they're making that much more on each loan sold. That's not passed down to the bankers. - Bonus checks (whether stock or otherwise) seems to be a thing of the past. In fact my first Christmas season they moved our commission check from mid month to end of month with no notice. - When working overtime you make half time. Yes you read that right, regular pay is near minimum wage for whatever state you live in. So say your base pay is $10.50 an hour, every hour after that is paid at $5.25 . - Rocket is actively pushing out operations. Either by offered buyouts, or at times threat of being moved to banking. So currently, banking is so bad that it's used as a punishment for those not willing to take the buyout. Bankers were not offered any type of severance. (I guess the punishment thing is a bit opinion). - You will learn a lot. I wouldn't personally say that the training is amazing, there is a lot of information at the tips of your fingers and if your director is helpful they can be a godsend. Besides that you need to be self motivated to learn. You'll have a lot of chances and see a lot of different things due to the sheer volume of clients you work with. If you need a foot in the door to get into banking, there are worse places you could go. - Rockets going to be here for the foreseeable future. As a business they're doing things to secure their foothold in the industry and to expand it. Most of you know how these companies get to be at the top. (Amazon, Walmart, etc). From my experiences the ones at the top of the tower look upward and onward seeing only blue skies while those below are crushed under their weight. Opinions - Leadership isn't as bad as some make it out to be. At least in my experience I met some really great people. Some awesome sales talent as well. There are bad eggs everywhere, but as far as I've seen there are a lot of very caring people there. Now once you get to the guys that like to have TV and radio shows to listen to their own voice, they're so out of touch with the regular person that it's almost as if they're not human. - I don't regret working there, but I do regret not working elsewhere when the market was good. I would've made a lot more. - Everything points to the shift of caring about their employees to caring about their shareholders. - Women can have a really rough time there depending on their leader. Like I said, bad eggs everywhere but Rocket has a weird control over you. The company itself tries to put safeguards against this but just be wary, there are other stories on here to back this. - Rocket employs mostly good people. I loved almost everyone I worked with, that's what kept me so long. The final thought I had was I hope that everyone stays in touch, but I realized if they don't just because I don't work with them anymore were they truly my friends? - Rocket enforces good sales skills. Following up, creating urgency, etc. If you're crap at sales and want to learn how to be pretty good they'll give you a clear structure of how to. - Quicken/Rocket WAS one of the best places to work. They've lost their way, however because this isn't translating to loss of revenue I highly doubt they'll change course. - Rocket promotes within, so just remember any time your boss or their boss etc is trying to get you to do something... they're selling you. They're salesman just as well as you are, and they've been doing it a lot longer. TIN FOIL HAT TIME- The big push in new software is so that an automated mortgage system can be created. They track everything so it's not a far jump to realize they're tracking which loans people are saying yes to, and then being able to automate that process. ""But there are laws in place that make it so a human has to write the loan"". Yes and we just saw Roe V Wade get repealed, you don't think a billion dollar business could lobby to make this happen? - Rocket is saving money so that when we hit a huge crash they can monopolize the industry. The soft pull push done by large lenders such as Rocket and UWM is pushing out credit trigger brokers and ""the little guy"". If banks start to fail and nobody has any money but these companies have their own stockpile they may just fund their own loans and take even more market share. - Rocket money, Rocket solar, Rocket auto etc. They're all there to gather information about your spending. The end goal is to be able to automate as many financial opportunities for the client which in theory is great. However my concern is a monopoly to which one company holds my mortgage, my energy bill, my auto loan, my credit card, etc. This one's a real stretch I know.Final thoughts.I understand why people still work there, for some they do make good money and they've built a career there. Others feel this is their best shot. You won't convince someone there that has ""drank the kool-aid"" that it isn't a good place to be. It's like walking into a church and telling everyone that God isn't real, it's cool if you want to be gay. Think about it this way, most of the people that want to stay have seen when Rocket was good, they've experienced them when they took care of their employees. To tell them that the place has turned to garbage is for them to accept that their livelihood was built on a landfill.  Sorry to put that so harshly, because it was a good place to be. My main point is this - Rocket can do better. (None of this should be taken as actual fact or views from Rocket as a company, just some ramblings of an internet weirdo who decided to share them, maybe I made it all up. Who knows, please don't sue me for my last pack of ramen noodles).",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread

Maybe go ahead and throw a regional while they’re at it, with super high level Rock Partners, let’s go ahead on Zoom and look at their basic NPC ‘personality traits’ like stadium mustard and goofy ass framed basketball jerseys in the background, and tell us how we can be successful by playing a YouTube video of Arnold Schwarzenegger working out, with some cliché background music to pump us up!

315,"Wanted to create an account and just share what was announced for the Cleveland site today.Earlier this morning, our DMB foreshadowed the site meeting that was to take place this afternoon stating “really good things coming for July don’t be late for the meeting.” So after hearing him say this some I was feeling some hope and looking optimistic for next month.Just had the site meeting. The site leader comes into the virtual call while on his nice vacation and says right off the bat “everyone will be smiling and feeling very good after this call, let’s dive right in!”After this my heart is racing, I’m getting really excited for what I’m about to hear. Could it be something less than 10 hour work days? Cutting back on the scheduled weekends in office? No more FORCING people to work every single non-scheduled weekend? Maybe a little salary bump to the 20k per year that hasn’t changed since 2007? Even out the lead tiers so that EVERYONE has a fighting chance to succeed? So many possibilities to improve when there are so many problems with this company! Nope.—Goals dropped by 1 for “most teams”—So those 10% in platinum get to enjoy even more money hitting higher payouts, while everyone else continues to get hung up on before they can say Hi. 95% of my day is spent completing opt-out forms for aggravated people that want the harassment to end. The credits that I do pull are still from the same remarketing lead pool so they’re all dead ends. If these people didn’t think a refi made sense when the rate was 2% or they didn’t qualify back then, why the fuck would they now???—We will be continuing the “reward” of going home at 4pm after you write a fresh application and get the client to sign in the same day.—Same statement as above. Great for those 10% with the silver spoons in their mouths. Doesn’t help burnout for anyone else. Also not even news, as our DMB already said we would be doing this next month.And just to be clear, I’ve been in platinum, I have made really, really good money in the past with this company. Platinum leads are currently people that are actually submitting their information, looking for something. Whether it be on our website directly or another website, they are submitting something. The rest of the banking force is getting remarketing which are leads anywhere from 6 months to 2 years old. Does anybody submit a lead for ANYTHING, a plumber, an electrician, a new car, literally anything at all and then receive numerous phone calls 8 months later and decide to do business with this company that’s blowing your phone the fuck up? Just curious.And now here is the most sickening part of the entire announcement.  —Goal and roll from July 24 through end of month if you hit 125% pace to goal before then and decide to USE YOUR OWN PTO—This is quite possibly the most disgusting “reward” I’ve ever seen from a company… how about I just use my own fucking pto for the last week of July and don’t give a fuck about goal????Last goal and roll we had was in December and they at least covered the time off. The big $384 in salary for that week. Now you’re saying I need to hit 125% pace to goal and I get the fucking PRIVILEGE of using up 40 hours of my PTO. “Christmas in July” he literally called it. Absolutely insane that this is real life. I would fucking take unpaid time off before I did that.-For the loyal team members that are not triple crowns, and not intro bankers getting real leads, continue to go fuck yourselves and enjoy 8:30am-7pm everyday and working every weekend and you might crack 4 digits on your next commission check.

333,"Reconciling my timecards and paystubs and here is what im finding:1) generally, YTD retro OT can simply just be multiplied by 2x to get whats been unpaid. They are calculating the regular rate correctly, just not giving it the premium 1.5x, only 0.5x. This makes unpaid retro OT easy to calculate (albeit some months are off a few pennys, but usually spot on)2) for regular base pay, its a completely different story. Your paid out OT and salary adjust is honestly a randomized nightmare and impossible to decipher. Adding up YTD OT and multiplying by 2x to get unpaid OT is a SIGNIFICANT UNDERESTIMATION of what is owed. A lot of bi-weekly periods you’d still be owed an extra $100-$200 on top of that, on average. Even if I factor in salary adjust OT and salary adjust. Unpaid OT on regular pay MUST be manually calculated (which takes a bit of time and effort)3) you may potentially be owed OT on bonus pay. We only get regular OT and commission OT, but no bonus OT. Not all bonuses would be eligible from my understanding (like gifts), but FOC referrals and other non-gift bonuses are. This is the smallest proportion of unpaid OT, but its not an insignificant amount. Easily a few hundred dollars.I definitely recommend you take the time to make an excel spreadsheet, reconcile your paystubs and timecards, and manually calculate what is owed to you. (Read up on FLSA overtime pay calculations first so its easier). No one else is going to do this the right way for you, you’re going to have to do it yourself to fight for what you are owed.",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread

344,"The market has destroyed this place. This is my repost  -Hours are long and COMPLETELY unnecessary. Especially the way the market is now. Typically 11 hour days Monday-Friday and mandatory/“volunteer” weekends. 60-65 hour weeks. If you don’t sign up they make you feel like dirt. You’ll sign up and get two-three calls and usually it’s people who hate Rocket. -Goal is unattainable and they make you feel better about it by lowering it by two. Which does nothing. -They cut our “salary”. -Company made BILLIONS the past two years, instead of flying as an eagle and helping their bankers, they fly like pigeons and crap all over us. -Big awkward meetings with otherwise NPCs (Non Playable Characters) aka ‘Rock Partners’ who remind you how great the company is because they are rich, sharing their love for Family, Sports, and Traveling, who went through the market crash in 08’ completely neglecting the fact it’s happening all over again, and 06’ and 07’ rates were not in the 2% range. -Meetings in general -Leadership constantly hiding information from bankers. -Robotic scripts you have to read that don’t work, any person with logic can see it’s scummy. -You have to harass clients 3-4 times a day via phone calls/texts until they scream and yell and ask to be off the list. If they don’t well you just keep calling. -Lead flow is abysmal, it use to be pretty bad with us harassing the elderly who click on a fb ad or people wanting free stimulus money, now it’s leads from two years ago during the boom who we couldn’t even help or are already put into a 2%- Borderline predatory lending with the way home values are today, putting people in loans that less than a year from now, they will be 100k under water, not to mention in a goofy 5-6% rate. Who really dictates these OUTLANDISH home values? What’s really going on here? -Try to persuade people that there’s bad debt and good debt, good debt being a mortgage and bad debt being credit cards etc, when in reality any debt is bad, and just because you transfer from credit cards to a 30 year mortgage doesn’t make it any better, especially when you read my above ‘Con’. The client is just going to go right back to using their credit cards. Not the company's fault, however let's not pretend we are ""helping"" anybody.- “Loan Tracking System”- “Underwriting Appointment” with my “Underwriter”- “Here’s How MY Process Works”
 
- “Talk Time” as if we are literally Elementary Children. Imagine having a Wife/Husband, or a Girlfriend/Boyfriend and you walk into the house, hang your top hat and coat up..your significant other says “Welcome home, Dear…how was your day?” To which you respond with a quivering voice “I don’t wanna talk about it…I got logged into my drive today…I missed talked time by 21 minutes…..TALK TIME SWEETHEART!!! DONT YOU UNDERSTAND?!” to which he or she just divorces you on the spot, as instead of being a professional Mortgage Banker you are treated like a 6 year old. -While the majority of bankers literally starve, the company allocates good leads (people actually interested in refinancing) to a select few of individuals who are used as a “token” to show other bankers that “hey, if I sacrifice my morales and personal time/soul with the company, I too can make 10k a check” of course that comes out to be about 5k a check after taxes. -Foundation transfers are one of the most
EMBARRASSING aspects of this ""professional"" company. Foundation dials out, reads their script really fast, does not finish their sentences and then iust drops the virtually flash banged client into the bankers pipeline, leaving the banker and client scrambling to make sense of it all.
What's worse, is this company DOES NOT care about that Imao, they literally don't. It sets both the foundation
banker up for failure, as they are doing the wrong thing,
and the mortgage banker as the client is dazed and
confused from the rambling. Not professional, it's
pathetic and desperate. Needs to be fixed, but it won't, and to me it’s absolutely MIND BOGGLING. -Honest to god 95% of the people we call have no idea why we are calling, have zero interest in refinancing, and every call turns into an argument. And if you can’t convince someone to rip their credit randomly in the first minute of the call, be prepared to have it listened to by everyone on your team. As hindsight is 20/20 and ThE iNtChEs wE nEeD aRe EvErYwHeRe ArOunD uS-JD Power Award lmaoooooooo-You should have seen how goofy things were after the Super Bowl, a cringe Super Bowl ad, and we were told we had to bring it up. “DiD yOu sEe oUr Ad!?” Most people had the response that it was, in fact, cringe. Again, billions made in the past two years and a chunk of it went to that? Wtf?-The fancy offices ie chandeliers and furniture, slushees and coffee (albeit I did like that) are a MAJOR smoke screen-Upper leadership often will have these little meetings where it appears they are “brainstorming” on what to do, with their note pads and big screens, only to hold a huge zoom meeting right after basically screwing everyone over, while the higher tenured and ‘ranked’ bankers do a goofy clap emoji in the meeting and say “wowww omg Rocket cares so much.” Have you ever seen a race horse with its horse blinders on? Yeah…it’s like that. 
 
-This place is a good example of how Orwellian a corporation can be. Micromanagement is OFF THE HOOK here, every thing you do is monitored, put on display and talked about, compared and contrasted. They talk about “running your own business” but Big Brother is not just the Feds who have control of literally every thing to do with fiat money, it’s the company you work for. Absolutely astonishing. -More than half the time, a loan doesn't even close as we are just forced to push it through, fortunately you get paid when it's Conditionally Approved. But be prepared for the client to blow you up.
-Leadership talks daily of helping Americans out, but these guys only care about making money, many who are successful here, this is all they know. The ability to bs your way on the phone with someone is rewarded, but you feel scummy at the same time. You have to be a borderline psychopath to do this as a career here…almost 70 hour weeks harassing people daily, that’s literally the job here, harassing individuals..I’m serious..psychopaths…
If you can deal with that, this place is for you. -At first, the cult vibes make you feel like you’re a part of something, with the ISMS and all, but after awhile you start to see the forest through the trees and you begin to realize not only does Rocket play Psychological games with their clients, they also play it on their bankers too. It’s truly fascinating, disturbing and Orwellian…Stay away. Don’t be tempted by the slight prospect to make a living here, or getting excited about calling yourself a “Mortgage Banker”, without sacrificing your dignity, your soul and mental health, you won’t get anywhere here.

352,"I quit rocket Mortgage about 3 weeks ago after over a year of CARI banking. While I wrote my fair share of “great loans” for happy clients, in and around February of 2022, I started to notice the lack of financial benefit for the client. I could get the loan AE, but the cost simply didn’t make sense, or the debt I was “rolling in” (NOT PAYING OFF I CANT STAND WHEN THEY SAY THEY’RE PAYING OFF DEBT ITS BEING ROLLED IN, NOT FUCKING PAID OFF) -anyways, the debts rolled in, didn’t make sense either. In some cases, my clients mortgage payments were going up $300+ and the overall savings were minuscule. I’m talking tens of dollars. Rocket would convince me that this makes sense. “As long as it’s saving them money it makes sense” and I to this day, still disagree with that and can’t wrap my head around how any financial person could sell that as if it makes sense. Rolling your debts that are going to be paid off in 2 years, into a 30 year (or even 20 year) mortgage at a rate 2% higher than what you’re at, does not make sense. Even if you’re saving $20 a month overall, you’re paying that higher payment for years, and years, and years. If you default on a credit card, your credit tanks, but if you don’t pay your house, Rocket will literally take it. Not to mention, you’re paying $100k + more in interest over the life of the loan. But it gets really sketchy when they would say “we’ll just refi them again in a year when rates drop” … is that not churning and who’s to say they’re even going to be able to refi in a year? I can name dozens of clients who accepted a refi under the assumption that “when rates go back down in a year, we’ll refi you into a lower rate” . This is a dangerous game IMO, teetering on the brink of illegality. Moral of the story (I guess), anyone else feel they were not fulfilling their fiduciary responsibilities to the client to ensure they’re putting said clients in a BETTER financial position? It felt extremely predatory and immoral. When I buy my first home, I plan to use Rocket, because I know with the friend referral I get a hefty discount so why not? However, as soon as I secure a loan I’ll be looking to refi away from Rocket and I can’t wait for the day my phone rings and some 21 year old banker calls me trying to screw me over because his director is holding a knife to his neck. It’s gonna be an interesting conversation. What was the “final straw” for you, as a banker? Again, mine was the feeling of immorality and that I was screwing people over with loans.",tqnhhl,loanoriginators,2022-03-29 00:31:41,7000.0,Reggimoral,loanoriginators,Rocket,Rocket Mortgage Megathread

5,"I began my career at Rocket Mortgage right out of high school and worked there for many years, consistently earning over $200,000 annually. However, with an 8-month-old daughter at home, I realized the demanding schedule of working 10–12+ hours a day, Monday through Saturday, no longer aligned with the life I wanted for my family. I’ve since transitioned to a different call center, where I now earn 1.5–1.75% per loan.For those seeking a better work-life balance at Rocket, it’s crucial to demonstrate your value to your Director of Mortgage Banking and VP. This often requires **at least a year of consistent performance**, particularly in terms of production volume. **Additionally, your ability to close clients significantly impacts the quality of leads you’ll receive. For example, if one banker achieves a 5% credit pull rate while another achieves 35%, the automated system will prioritize feeding leads to the latter because they are statistically more likely to convert those leads to applications.**Rocket Mortgage has an incredible culture, but it’s important to recognize that your experience can vary depending on your director. Building strong relationships with your fellow mortgage bankers is key. When I was a new hire (after the ramp-up period), I was fortunate to join a team comprised mostly of Executive, President's Club, and Triple Crown bankers. They were genuinely invested in my success and consistently offered support and advice. Their mentorship played a significant role in my early achievements and, surpassing everyone in my SAFE graduation class by a landslide. If you’re starting at Rocket, I recommend preparing to work 60+ hours a week during your first year. This commitment will help you establish your reputation and increase your chances of long-term success. During my time there, I had the privilege of earning multiple incentives, including three JFC trips, four March Madness trips, and financial success beyond my dreams at 20 years old. Everything I put on my ""vision"" board as a new banker, I have sense checked off. This is actually a reminder that I should create a new vision board for 2025.

I can confirm what someone else said about them encouraging you to spend as soon as you earn it. There was a top level originator when I was there making 400k+ and still living paycheck to paycheck. Use it as a good learning experience and way to get your foot in the door but save that money and always have an exit strategy because they will fire you for the smallest reasons if they want. Also can confirm the long hours. When I was there it was minimum 55 per week and don’t hold your breath on wfh.

13,"If you have no experience in mortgages then Rocket Mortgage is the best place to learn. I’ve been there for 10 years and over seven of those years in leadership. I can attest that it will be a grind your first year and it will get easier over time. Whoever your leader is, it will make a big difference because there’s some really really really good ones and some horrible ones but frankly most are just in the middle. Rocket Mortgage has amazing benefits, especially when we talk about healthcare. Hell we own our own Pharmacy and you can get over-the-counter stuff for like a dollar which is normally like $20 at CVS.I would tell you this. Do the job. Get trained. Keep an open mind and learn. Give it your all for one year and reassess. Realistically you’ll work 50 maybe 60 hours. Finally, I would say this. Anyone who is not currently working there and is mentioning their experience from years and years ago it’s not the same company.

0,Rocket all the way because I don’t want to be a branch of UWM. I am a broker. UWM is hurting broker competition by trying to stifle the competition behind a mask of being “all-in for the brokers”.

2,I only have uwm because they’re in my LOS Arive. Otherwise it’s maybe a personal choice. I send my loans to top priced lenders so we can collect the full margin. UWM is pretty much never there and usually 50-150 bps out from the top priced lender. But perhaps that’s the case because I’ve only sent one loan there (DSCR) which they actually have great pricing for.UWM tech is alright. I feel like there’s way too many people touching a loan at UWM. I’ve honestly had much better experiences sending loans to Windsor and Power. The people at UWM do not seem to know anything compared to people at other lenders. That’s not their fault but it’s incredibly frustrating.,1eoulaq,loanoriginators,2024-08-10 14:39:20,45.0,Outside_Equal_6075,loanoriginators,Rocket,UWM vs ROCKET
3,"Plenty to complain about with both of them. I took the UWM pill last year and it was pretty dogshit. If you don’t almost exclusively use them you’re basically not a broker for them. Their incentives are predatory in a monopoly sense, basically giving you the ability to push loans through that have no business being cleared or get better pricing. But if you’re doing let’s say 20% of your volume with UWM you’ll never see the benefits and your AE will basically ignore you. Their UW is also a mess. The whole place just has too many cooks. They’re so overinflated, having visited their campus it feels like they’re bound to implode seeing it person. I can’t confidently say UWM did anything of notable benefit that I couldn’t have done with another lender except good pricing here and there.I’m currently using rocket. They don’t like hairy files at all but if you get approve eligible and don’t have a messy borrower they’re very easy to close with. I don’t find myself getting over conditioned with them the way I did with UWM. They’re very thorough on clean approvals and don’t throw much at you after that. UWM would practically withdraw and resubmit my loan after popping an ICD like they had 20 UWs wanting to take a whack at it like a piñata.",1eoulaq,loanoriginators,2024-08-10 14:39:20,45.0,Outside_Equal_6075,loanoriginators,Rocket,UWM vs ROCKET

8,"I’ve had experience working with both UWM and Rocket, and there are pros and cons to each. In terms of pricing, they are fairly competitive, but I’ve found that Rocket sometimes offers a slight advantage. However, I’m not a fan of the mandatory video content UWM requires to improve rankings, and the ‘club fraternity’ atmosphere at their Detroit headquarters doesn’t resonate with me. Additionally, the ‘Control Your Price’ (CYP) program at UWM strikes me as a bit silly, as it seems unnecessary for what should be a straightforward process.On the positive side, I’ve had good experiences with UWM on purchase transactions, but their streamline processes have been consistently challenging and frustrating. While I understand that UWM has recently hired a number of new employees who are still getting up to speed, this has affected the overall service quality.Lastly, I’m concerned about UWM’s policy of penalizing brokers for working with Rocket, especially since Rocket does not impose similar restrictions. Overall, while both lenders have their strengths, there are aspects of UWM’s approach that give me pause.",1eoulaq,loanoriginators,2024-08-10 14:39:20,45.0,Outside_Equal_6075,loanoriginators,Rocket,UWM vs ROCKET

Dan Gilbert of Rocket is a POS, treats his employees like absolute shit, I’m from Cleveland one of their 3 big operations centers is there and everyone I’ve ever met who has worked there absolutely hated the company. Also Rocket’s DNA is a call center and they’ll call all your past clients and steal your refinances! UWM has the most seamless technology in the business, makes it super easy to get files done. UWM haters don’t like the CEO because he’s an outspoken bulldozer making big needed changes in the business and he blocks you from using rocket and a couple other call center investors because those places end goal does not align with the end goal of the brokers out there and only align with them stealing your business and clients. Places like Rocket’s end goal is to have consumers starting and finishing their loan directly with Rocket and cutting the independent loan officer out of the transaction completely. UWM’s model is broker’s first and making sure the independent loan officer remains an important part of the transaction and we all don’t have to go work for some mega company in a call center environment making $500 per closed deal.",1eoulaq,loanoriginators,2024-08-10 14:39:20,45.0,Outside_Equal_6075,loanoriginators,Rocket,UWM vs ROCKET

16,"If he is a neighbor worth keeping (they exist), then sit with him over a beer and try to figure out the best way to proceed. If he has the means to cover most or all of hit, be grateful and forgiving and chip in for the beer and BBQ. If you need to chip in a bit to keep a family friend, remember that you've helped each other out over many years. Good neighbors are worth the investment.If he can't cover it all and the cost is too high for you to cover or want to cover, then you must get insurance involved and just suck up what you can. Again, is he a neighbor/friend worth having? If he is genuinely repentant, don't guilt him for too long or too hard.If the loss is too extreme and the pain is too much, get a police report and a lawyer and insurance involved and sue for damages.  If this is your ultimate fallback, remember to keep your kids from doing anything stupid for the foreseeable future. He might crave a little payback.Remember at all times, however, that insurance is a necessary evil, and no insurance company will EVER be your friend. They will raise your rates regardless, because that is their business model. You are a cash cow to be maintained for the lowest cost until you stop producing. Then you're ground beef. But never a friend.Take some time to think it through. Life is complicated.

Measure it, then measure it again and go online and see what Home Depot or Lowe's has. For the total cost of a getting a new sheet of glass and the labor for it, it might be to your advantage to replace it.For example - say it costs a total of $300 to repair the window and $500 for a new one.

My neighbor on the other side left some mortar (launch and go boom) fireworks behind when he moved and so I lit them off one super-foggy afternoon figuring that nobody would be able to see me doing illegal things.Two of them went off without a hitch. On the third shot, the mortar tube fell over as the fuse was burning down. It went off aimed directly at my other neighbor's bedroom windows. It bounced off the little vinyl intersection of the top and bottom window and 3 feet later, it went off. Had it gone up or down an inch, it would have punched straight through their window and gone off above their bed.Which while that would have been a somewhat hilarious story to tell, I feel like my neighbor would have found it far less entertaining.",1dvoeme,homeowners,2024-07-05 03:22:38,327.0,BravoFoxtrotDelta,homeowners,Rocket,Neighbor shot a rocket through my picture window and it detonated in my living room.

3,"Not to defend rocket mortgage, they've always seemed scammy. But.....this is pretty standard for the mortgage process. Documents are only valid for 30, 60, or 90 days depending on the lender and document type. So you send everything over and get pre-approved and think it's all good. But when you actually have an offer accepted, half of your documents are 'expired', so you send them again. Oh, but if you sent bank statements today, they're for the month of August right? Which isn't a problem. Unless you close October 2nd, then you have to provide the September bank statements before closing can happen. I found it super helpful to just have a folder on my desktop that I dumped every new bank statement, brokerage statement, pay stub, etc into and labeled them ""Date - Document Type"".

I knew their rates weren't the best but it came down to a difference of less a grand, and my local bank took >24 hrs to get back to me by phone each day, when they did, it was at work where I cant really talk on the phone while large, loud industrial equipment is running 5 feet away from me, and could only do one thing at a time.

Our agent, and the seller's agent warned us and didn't want us to use Rocket, but we defended our choice.We are closing.. well WERE supposed to close 12/30. Now it's been changed to 01/04. This is completely due to rocket's lack of knowledge of State law.There was zero communication from Rocket and our Agent. If I had not be on top of every aspect of our loan, according to our agent this wouldn't have even gone through. Rocket has broke several state laws. I had to forward emails to my agent because they refused to do it. They REFUSED to edit paperwork as well, making my agent do things they should have done.Our appraisal came back with only one issue, which was fitting the water heater with straps. The appraiser also said it wasn't a big deal and that it could be ""insured with escrow repair."" which according to HUD means the loan can go through on time and allow us to make the repair within a time frame. Rocket refuses to acknowledge this. The only reason for that is because they plan on immediately selling our loan to another company, but they won't talk about that either. Which from days of research is the only reason they won't let us do the repairs. Rocket offers repair escrows for minor repairs, just not to us.Rocket mortgage changed our closing date illegally. In Washington state, it's not up to the lender, it's up to the seller and our agents. The seller has to approve it, they can tell us to piss off and cut our contract if they wanted. Rocket refuses to abide by WA state law.We signed a 3 day appraisal waiver, which in our state is also against the law. They hid the date the appraisal happened and when they got it back. We only got a copy of it a couple days ago, if repairs had to happen there wouldn't be enough time to even discuss it.Like the OP, we had many issues with paperwork, and things not being done properly or in a timely fashion. We had at least 5 people working on our case which caused even more issues because the right hand wasn't talking to the left hand. We'd get the OK from one specialist and then get it refused by another.They have increased our cost to close many times with out telling us why and haven't updated our disclosure package or given us itemization sheet or anything. It's increased by $3000. I have to agree with the OP and to avoid this company at all costs. They will defend their company and say these things won't happen, but they will.

My wife and I just closed on our first house yesterday, and went with RM. Originally we applied for financing with out local credit union, but they were giving us a difficult time because my wife switched jobs in the last year. They sent us a rejection letter based on the job change, so we began shopping elsewhere and settled on Rocket. Later our credit union got back to us and decided they could approve us, but the whole process left a bad taste in our mouths and we decided to stay with Rocket.The entire process with Rocket was incredibly smooth, and we were able to get pre-approved quickly and painlessly. Once we had an offer accepted, we were able to close in 11 days. I made sure to provide any and all documents requested, and definitely stayed in top of things, but every Rocket employee I worked with was extremely professional and competent. Of course closing in 11 days also required things like the appraisal to move on schedule, and the sellers to have everything together on their end. Our agent said it's by far the fastest non-cash closing he's ever had.I'm guessing with a company as big as Rocket, it really depends on the individuals you get working on your application. We were extremely lucky everyone was on the ball, and that we weren't left waiting for weeks on the appraisal.

Apparently, I no longer qualified for the OnePlus program I qualified under and then the rocket mortgage incentive for using a preferred agent I was no longer qualified for because of my DTI, which has not changed since my original approval and the OnePlus did not have PMI attached, so essentially Rocket screwed me so bad that I have no choice but to move forward with an astronomical house payment and sell mine because my house is under contract.What ever you do, do not use Rocket Mortgage.",povvi6,homeowners,2021-09-15 18:24:59,307.0,bobjohnsonmilw,homeowners,Rocket,Warning: Avoid Rocket Mortgage at all costs

62,"My experience has been generally good but it really depends on who you are working with. I have a mortgage with them but wanted to add another loan to the mix. This is where things got crazy. 
My previous loan had an appraisal and everything went through as expected. Several months later I had to have another appraisal since I wanted to combine loans. The appraisal was identical to the previous one but several things had to be fixed. A garage and an out building were now required to be repainted. 
I thought the appraisal would include the value of the buildings in their current condition not some future condition after repainting. 
Other things were supposed to be fixed. A basement shower is supposed to be defective but there is no explanation about what’s broken. A power panel cover is supposed to be reinstalled in an out building. They act as though this is an insurance condition but my insurance cleared it. 
The repainting issue could reduce the value of the property by a few thousand but this shouldn’t be an issue. The appraisal did not accurately assess the property value apparently. 
It’s now 18 degrees outside and I I have 5 inches of snow but it appears that they want me to start painting to fix appraisal issues. I raised this with them but instead of working the issue they decided to drop my application.

75,"I first tried to use RM about five years ago. I was getting divorced and keeping the house, and was trying to get my ex’s name off everything. When I started, I gave them a $500 “deposit.” This was to cover the cost of the appraisal. If the deal fell through it was fully refundable less any amount they actually paid an appraiser. At that time, it appraised significantly underwater. I would have had to come up with something like $12k to cover the shortage and also pay the closing costs. I had to bow out. I received a partial refund from the $500. I don’t remember how much, but $150 is what comes to mind. It seemed fair at the time.Fast forward to a couple months ago. A conversation with a friend clued me in to the fact that rates are really good right now. I called them again and got preapproved for 2.75%. (Maybe not the greatest rate out there, but I have mediocre credit and my current rate is 5.25% so this is still a significant savings. And my main goal here is still to get my ex’s name off everything.) This time I was not asked to provide any cash up front towards the appraisal or anything else. Started sending them all my documentation…and the fact that I used a private mailbox as a billing address for most things became a problem. Cancelled that app, started over again two weeks later. I’m now about six weeks in to the second try. My appraisal was completed September 1. It appraised significantly higher than I was expecting, so I called my banker to ask if I could take some cash out. I posed this question during the initial application process, and was told it wouldn’t be a problem to increase the amount. (I had made the banker aware of my previous situation and the fact that I was just paranoid that it wouldn’t appraise high enough to take out any cash.) I called my banker either 9/1 or 9/2 and left him a voice mail asking if I could withdraw cash. Because of the Labor Day holiday, I didn’t expect to hear back from him till 9/7 at the earliest. 9/9 I sent him an email to follow up. 9/13 they put a to-do on my list to acknowledge the closing disclosure, which still reflects only a payoff and no cash back to me. 9/14 I sent a message on their message board feature about this and the response was only “we’ll relay that to your banker.”The process is currently stalled anyway, because the appraiser indicated that I have to have the exterior trim scraped and painted. The earliest a painter can get here is next week, and then I have to have it inspected. But I’m annoyed that it’s now been two weeks of radio silence from the banker. It makes me wonder, does he even still work there? Did he suddenly get sick and have to take some sort of leave? There was no auto-response on his email and nothing on his voice mail about being gone either. Up until this point, my only complaint was that I was asked to provide a couple of documents twice mere days apart. This isn’t the same scenario described in another comment, where they wanted an updated bank statement. They asked twice for my divorce decree, which obviously wouldn’t change at all, and I think the other document I had to provide twice was my 2020 W-2.",povvi6,homeowners,2021-09-15 18:24:59,307.0,bobjohnsonmilw,homeowners,Rocket,Warning: Avoid Rocket Mortgage at all costs

93,"I've had good and bad experiences with getting mortgages lined up. It's not just Rocket Mortgage. FWIW, we used them to refi and they were totally fine. But the deadlines/time pressures aren't the same as when buying. We did the refi early on during the pandemic when the rest of the country was doing the same and mortgage companies were overwhelmed with work. To their credit, Rocket was actually able to get us done in a relatively timely manner and still had just about the best rates out there at the time. (One other had slightly lower total costs but their representative was uncommunicative--clearly spread too thin at that time--and so I didn't have confidence moving forward with them.)

We even came up against our rate lock deadline waiting for things to process and it was trivial to get an extension (though perhaps that was in part because rates were completely flat at the time). I’m not at all saying the process was a stroll in the park, but on balance I guess we were satisfied customers. All of this being said, I’m not sure whether I’d use them if I was buying again. It probably would depend on where I was buying and how much time pressure I had to get it done. I’d go local for sure if trying to move on something quickly. Also, Rocket Mortgage is a little annoying when servicing your loan.

115,"I seriously hate rocket mortgage!!! The insane amount of reasons goes well beyond the closing process, which was a mess. I should have ran away fast. First the closing costs were supposed to be around 6500 and ended up being almost 9000. They couldn't give me a reason why it was so much higher and from the disclosure statement it appears that they charged us twice for our homeowners insurance. I spent so much time on the phone about this and was told any discrepancies would be fixed on closing day. Well guess what they weren't. I went ahead with the closing but was hoping things would get straightened out later and thought they would just issue me a check once they saw an error. That didn't happen. It's been a year. If I wouldn't have needed the equity to pay the bathroom contractor and trusted that things would be fixed I wouldn't have signed. But he was coming in February to start and it was almost December at this point. We began this loan process in early October so I knew it may take a few months to start over.  The next problem was in December when they didn't pay our real estate taxes. They instead paid our homeowners insurance that aren't even due until February. It took me several days and several transfers through different departments to get it straightened out. And finally, now they are saying we have a $60 escrow shortage even though our taxes went down this year and our homeowners is the same price as last year. So our monthly payment should actually be decreasing by $2 per month not increasing. I'm sure when I contact them about it I will have to spend hours trying to fix it just to be given some excuse that makes no sense. Listen, I've bought several houses over the past 23 years and know what I'm doing. If I were you I'd give my business to someone else.

I had 2 competing lenders I was working with.Rocket not only gave me the best rate (started the process about a month before rates started to shoot up), but when I presented them with competing loan estimates, they worked to shave expenses off to keep it competitive and worth it to use them instead.Closing went off without much of a hitch. There were some documents I needed to re-upload which aggravated me, but there were no issues at close. The closing costs actually ended up being substantially less than the estimate, which made us really happy.I was REALLY scared and had a 'is this too good to be true?' moment here and there. I saw bad reviews of Rocket but my experience wasn't matching the reviews, so I thought some bad news was coming down the way.Nope, everything went fine, saved a lot of $, and the team was helpful and closed really fast.

128,"Here's my experience:Use extreme caution and if possible, just go with someone else. What they don't tell you: THEY WILL SELL YOUR LOAN FOR PROFIT. They will tell you nothing will change but this is NOT TRUE. Here's the story: The process started easy enough, the agent whom I was dealing with made everything sound super easy and I genuinely liked him at first. A big selling point of our home was the monthly payment. We were determined to stay within a certain range. The price we were given was a bit higher than we expected; however, the agent informed us that there was a PMI on the loan. He said that its a bit more now... but being that we got SUCH a good deal on the house, we would only have to wait around a year to get this off. Furthermore, he said that if we wanted to get this off sooner, that all we needed to do was increase the value of our home to meet the criteria. We put at least 20k into the home and then called back. The lady made a list of the improvements and informed us that all we needed was to allow them to come do their own appraisal and we'd be good to go, PMI free. I needed a little time to get the fee together that they asked for and when I called back, I was informed that my loan was suddenly sold to another company... I was assured absolutely nothing would change and that the list we made would be forwarded over to seamlessly complete the process. Upon speaking to the new company, they did receive the list; however, they have different policies and now I would only be able to take off the PMI if I paid over 22k to my principal balance. We would have used the 20k we put into the house IF WE WERE NOT LIED TO. Instead, we are stuck struggling with a payment that is higher than promised until God knows when. It's all a big scheme to have you lose your home and they MAKE MORE MONEY off the poor.

I opted to keep the payments as low as possible and send in $2000 for escrow along with my monthly payment of $700. Later that month I began receiving calls that my mortgage was going into default for nonpayment, and I owed $900 for the month. I immediately showed proof that I sent 2000 and so the payment should be 700 and then showed proof that I sent 700 it turns out what happened was they put the whole $2700 into escrow and then treated it like I made no escrow payment and owed $900, since then I have made my $700 payments every month so everything on my end was correct but they continue to screw things up with re-allocating funds and the like. I continued paying up to this day as I was supposed to and my 700+ credit score dropped to 500s. In a panic I looked into it and sure enough, Rocket mortgage says I’m in default.

131,"I had been pre-approved by Derek Radel to handle our loans and Alex Gorgen as my realtor. Initially the website had my loan set at $100,000 less than the approval on my letter, which I had to call Derek to fix. I talked to Alex one time and he has ghosted me for a month after promising to walk homes for us virtually because we are buying out of state. Alex told me to sign up on a different search engine then Rocket Mortgage so it is 'more efficient and updates', however as we know, you want us to go through Rocket Mortgage so we can collect tokens for doing research and homework like a child to give a better closing cost that you actually could just give the buyer instead of doing award-based activities to make them feel better about a purchase! Still I tried to do everything I was told like watching videos and gaining points after taking quizzes for a better closing cost while simultaneously looking through a different portal for Alex saving homes he was supposed to follow up on. Three weeks has gone buy with nothing from Alex but his automated search engine (Not Rockets) that sends me homes that are not even in my criteria! 
   So I tried to talk to Derek Radel about what house qualifies since after doing my own research on manufactured homes (most of the only homes populating) are on unimproved roads that most FHA and conventional loans won't finance, they have to be 1975 or newer and they have to be permenant homes (which is really hard with manufactured homes to be considered). Their are HUD plates that need to be looked for to find out if qualification can take place on any age manufactured homes. 
  Because Alex wasn't getting back to me about my questions, Derek said to send me over any prospective house and he could research and make sure they were able to qualify. I sent him two properties with MLS and he said those 'look good' and quoted the text found at the bottom of any home search engine about it being cash or conventional. I waited for them to get back to me and when I complained that Andrew went 'Radio Silent' he told me all I had to do was to give him, Derek the listings and he would check them out. I told him I sent him two listings and I am the one doing all the research here. I was told I could trust these individuals to find me an out-of-state home and  here I can't trust them to get back to me. I told him I talked to other list realtors and they don't want to work with Rocket at all and warned me my pre-approval was not legit. Derek told me you don't get to be as big as Rocket if you hand out fake approvals! I replied that Rocket has changed it's name so it does not mean biggest is always best. Today, he said he is insulted and is not going to work with me anymore because he stopped texting me and I texted him that he seems to be ""ghosting me"" which has enraged him so much he is done with me! He did nothing and neither did any of the three agents I got paired with. This seems like a scam if not just a waste of my time and watching houses I love just get snatched up! Of course Derek does this over Memorial weekend   so we can't get a hold of anyone (not like I could before). I have left messages with Chris Ray, head of realtors with no follow up. This has been my worst nightmare! My husband has to relocate for his job and this was time sensitive which I told everyone. In the end Derek is incredibly immature and ignorant to handle this the way he did. I had to research everything about loans and send him the questions with telling me it will be fine.

143,"ROKET IS THE WORST!!!We applied with rocket and the day before we were supposed to close they decided to not make enough? If we didn’t qualify we wouldn’t have wasted the sellers, agents and our time. They said it was something that couldn’t have been determined until the end. I was like uhhh. That makes zero sense. Income and credit would be the first things you check. I understand not knowing exact numbers of cash to close etc. But I feel as if we were just robbed of 500 bucks from their “good faith” deposit. We didn’t take any loans out, credit is 708, we had the cash, they had everything they needed. It’s annoying when we’re being compliant and we’re so careful about everything and getting excited just for it all to fall through. Ive worked in lending so I have a general idea of how things work and what they look for. The sellers were going to pay for all of the repairs via escrow so everyone is now in a bind for lack of better words. Thank god we have an amazing agent who is helping us in the right direction of a new lender and trying to push this all forward. It feels as if our lender dropped the ball and it should’ve been looked at way sooner so we didn’t get this deep. Hoping we get qualified with this new lender and find out if we really don’t make enough. 🤞🏽",povvi6,homeowners,2021-09-15 18:24:59,307.0,bobjohnsonmilw,homeowners,Rocket,Warning: Avoid Rocket Mortgage at all costs

For example, They told me they needed 500.00 for an inspection report...fine. Later they suggested that the total for the report was 1k and the 500 was just what was needed at that time. It all sounds good upfront. In our case we complained and they removed 3k of that. I like Rocket Mortgage as far as ease and convenience of use...I needed a home quickly due to factors that most people won't have and was basically backed into a corner. However, if you're not in a hurry then shop around and be ready to back out (or fight with them for a better rate) be prepared for last minute costs...like a week or so before closing when you're packed up and ready to move. I won't be refinancing with them when the time comes.Their website promotes the shield protection (one free float down)...and they basically told us we couldn't use that. Total B.S and I made a lot of assumptions about things that weren't in the contract.As well, they will ask you for a lot of paperwork last minute. Mine wasn't as bad as some people (who missed closing date). So, my entire situation was less than a month and I had to show proof of income....well that expires in less than a month's time. So you will be uploading the same documents again and again. Days before closing and (in my case) when everything was put away. So, keep all documents in a folder and ready to reupload.And just to give reference I have 800+ credit, income and assets in the bank that would essentially pay for the home bought. So, a sure low-risk thing. So, anyone going forward with them...you need to be firm and advocate for yourself. I don't  have to pay Mortgage Insurance, put very little down and they were very easy to work with while the local mortgage companies weren't very helpful and expected me to do everything on my own. So, I paid for speed.",16vakln,homeowners,2023-09-29 12:39:47,87.0,gobgobgobgob,homeowners,Rocket,Looking for advice – Are Rocket Mortgage really going to bait and switch me right before closing?
0,The big complaint I hear about these companies is that they frequently fail to hit deadlines. In this market that can mean losing the sale because sellers will have no trouble finding another buyer. In our case the sellers straight up said they would only accept our offer if we switched from an online mortgage company to a local one because they didn’t want to run the risk of delays and hang ups if they went with our offer. We went with the local credit union and were extremely happy with the experience. I would send the advice to stay local if you can.,p472m6,homeowners,2021-08-14 12:24:31,67.0,AgileSeaworthiness20,homeowners,Rocket,Rocket Morgatge

2,"I heard this too when I went with Rocket mortgage.  My experience with them was fine. Not great but not poor. It was clear the person I was working with was new which led to redo of some paperwork.  Not a huge deal but nothing of the horror stories I've heard from others. From what I can tell - many (not all) who have an issue with Rocket are those with less than ideal circumstances who have to deal with a company designed for straight forward loans, or those who have excellent circumstances and don't need to pay the larger fees you see from Rocket.  I fell into the latter but it was easy for me to negotiate the fees down which I may not have had to do with another lender.My advice - if you have any kind of abnormal situation - avoid Rocket at all costs.  If it's a straight up buy/refi where you meet all standard criteria and buying a standard, run of the mill home, they are an option to potentially consider.",p472m6,homeowners,2021-08-14 12:24:31,67.0,AgileSeaworthiness20,homeowners,Rocket,Rocket Morgatge
3,"I had a good experience with Rocket Mortgage, but it was a refi, not a purchase. For the purchase I went through a local lender.  But a few years later, I was able to remove PMI and lower my rate 1.5% by refinancing as a conventional mortgage through Rocket. That process was very quick and easy. 
This seems to gel with everyone else’s experience. Use the local lender for a purchase, then try Roxket later as a refi.",p472m6,homeowners,2021-08-14 12:24:31,67.0,AgileSeaworthiness20,homeowners,Rocket,Rocket Morgatge

6,I just bought a house (my second) and I had a great experience with them. The best part is that they don’t sell your debt to a terrible servicing company.

8,"Went with them twice the last 2.5 years. They were great, better in 2018, than 2021 but still good. My fiancé and I work opposite schedules and everything you do you sign online, on an app on your phone. Made us having opposite schedules super easy to do. I had friends that had to bring things to a bank and schedule meetings with their significant other and the bank and we got to do everything on our time. I’m not sure sellers even know where your mortgage is through. I never did, I just was told what kind of mortgage it was and if there was contingencies for it. Personally if I’m selling, I’m taking whatever money is the most or deal is better and I don’t care where that moneys coming from. That last statement from your realtor sounds kind of dumb to make, they’re one of the largest companies right now and they don’t get that way from people walking away. I would prefer using a local credit union or something but the ease and convenience is just too good to pass up.",p472m6,homeowners,2021-08-14 12:24:31,67.0,AgileSeaworthiness20,homeowners,Rocket,Rocket Morgatge

12,"I’m in the mortgage industry.*What Rocket Mortgage does:*
They have a pretty good process for a very limited segment of the population. If you have a W2, and your company works with their verification database, and your bank works with their verification database, and your home/LTV doesn’t require an appraisal- they have a “rocket” process for you. The reality is that a lot of banks can do this, but Quicken/Rocket Mortgage is much better at advertising it.That said, if you don’t fit into that narrow bucket, your process will take a lot longer, because they have to go through the traditional mortgage process and they’re *bad* at it. Fine for a refinance, but for a purchase, this could lose you the house. Much better to get a local lender (even a local person with a big bank is fine. Look at reviews, ask your realtor, shop a few people and go with the person that takes the time to explain everything to you, even if their rate is .125% higher. Its worth it).Quicken/Rocket Mortgage is also *notorious* for advertising rates that come from <75% LTV (which is cheaper than an 80% LTV that most people are looking for) *and* quoting 2 points on their rates. Its extremely deceiving when you see their 2.625% rate and they say “oh closing is $4500”, and their competitor has 2.875% and a $700 closing fee. The competitor can get the same rate if you want to pay points. You have to pay attention!Edit: LTV means “loan to value”. Its an expression of how much equity or down payment. If you’re putting 20% down, your LTV is 80%.Points are an optional upfront charge to lower your interest rate. In the low rate environment we have now,  it seems to be about 6-8 years to break even on most point buys. For a lot of people its not really worth it.",p472m6,homeowners,2021-08-14 12:24:31,67.0,AgileSeaworthiness20,homeowners,Rocket,Rocket Morgatge
13,"I had a short experience with them while shopping around for lenders.I figured, quick, convenient process completely through the internet? Sure, why not?The process of uploading my information was indeed quick and easy. I received a call a few hours later from an agent. They just wanted to clarify a few things with me. I explained that I already had a pre-approval, and wanted to do a little shopping around to potentially get a better rate. Agent says sure, no problem at all, let me run some numbers and see if we can beat that rate (I never told them the rate I wanted them to beat). He says he'll call me back ""later today, perhaps Monday“. No problem, I was still in the house shopping process, I had some time.I'll have been in my house for 2 years next month.

15,"Do not recommend. I was doing a refinance a couple of years ago and got a quote from them because it was easy to do and I wanted to see if they were competitive. They had incredibly aggressive sales tactics. Like a bad used car salesman. When I turned them down they kept calling back, using tricks like calling from different numbers, text messages, emails. The broker annoyed the hell out of me for a month. I felt like I had a stalker. That particular experience aside, I’d only use online mortgages for refis and not purchases. Refis it’s generally no big deal if they miss the close date and you can shop for the bottom dollar rate. For purchases, I’ve got a local broker that is Mr. Hustle. He may not be the cheapest (he’s close, though) but he makes deals happen fast, does not make mistakes, and there is none of the drama I hear about with some of the online brokers. I do not want to risk my closing on some anonymous 25 year old broker in Ohio when I’m buying.",p472m6,homeowners,2021-08-14 12:24:31,67.0,AgileSeaworthiness20,homeowners,Rocket,Rocket Morgatge

23,"I had a so-so to slightly negative experience with Rocket on a refi. It was during Covid, so we definitely expected some delays, since everyone and their mom was doing a refi in 2020. But, there were a few instances where I had to follow up on things I felt like they should have been taking care of. They faxed my original mortgage company the payoff letter request, not realizing they faxed it to the wrong bank. No surprise, they didn't receive a response. After three weeks nobody at RM had realized what the issue was, or why. I had to track down the right fax number, and put the two sides in contact to get it fixed. I live in a city, so it's not like it was some no-name bank either. There were more instances of this type of lax effort throughout the process. I probably wouldn't use them again as a buyer/refi, but I also don't think I'd walk away from an offer as a seller if they chose to use them.

The home was built in 1993 and is average for the area. Traditional standard mortgage loan. No movement on the loan process for weeks with the deadline from the home seller fast approaching. Poor communication from my agent and others within the working group. Thankfully I did refuse their upfront inspection fee and they waived it or else I would have been out additional money. I switched lenders to guild mortgage that has local agents and offices in my area. They got me a better rate, lower closing fees, and were able to close in three weeks right before the sellers deadline.

12,"Currently buying a home. Started working with Rocket. Run!Part of the reason Rocket was appealing was for the 1.25% closing credit they offered. That was going to be a big help and I was OK with slightly higher fee if that was the case.Got connected with a loan officer and started the process. I asked for loan estimates to see how much cash I needed to bring to closing and she sent me an email (not a loan estimate) that gave vague estimates for things like origination, taxes, insurance, etc. It was WILDLY over the usual 4% we estimate. We went back and forth with trying to get a proper estimate. I also asked if that included the 1.25% closing credit.That's when she told me she was in a ""special"" Rocket department that had lower fees, but didn't offer the credit. Bait. Switch. Since she was a local rep, she was offering a discounted pricing sheet, getting me much better rates than what I would get off the website with the closing credit. I told her I was going to shop around and required a proper loan estimate. After days of back and forth, I got a loan estimate with a higher rate, higher loan origination, and a mystery ""other charges"" line item of $10k.

19,"Rocket has a lot more overhead to cover, so their rates are a bit higher...however, they do have the ability to request that their capital markets give concessions to bring the rate/pricing down IF there is a verified offer of a lower rate. But their basic rate/pricing is worse than most lenders to cover the overhead.   
As far as DTI,  fannie mae is a bit more relaxed in qualifying variable income, whereas freddie mac is more explicit in when it's eligible and how it has to be calculated.  Rocket will require loans to qualify for the more stringent guideline so that they can sell it to either agency.    Freddie mac has rules about variance related max for stability. But at rocket there is a form that just gets filled out up front with the numbers from paystubs and w2's. It will automatically calculate and flag any 10% variance due to the freddie guidelines.   
The underwriters don't get to run different calculations or change what the loan officer has entered unless the numbers are incorrect.    I've seen the system even flag the 10% variance even on base pay.   
Therefore, it may just be that the loan office chose to only use base income to qualify to avoid that issue.   They might need to go with freddie mac for some other guideline/approval reasons and stuck with that 10% variance rule.   
Also, rocket tends to be more conservative on their underwriting by choice, even if other lenders would be okay with it.   
That being said, your DTI doesn't affect pricing. your fico score, loan amount, ltv and property type does, but fico, not so much, so at the end of the day, the dti used doesn't matter too much as long as it qualifiesThere is a website for weekly rates from freddie mac at [www.freddiemac.com/pmms](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms)  however, note that those are the rates locked last week and can vary from where they are this week.     
You do have to take those rate comparisons with a grain of salt though, because there is more to determining what an actual rate is than just one or two numbers and frequently, the advertised rate is only availalbe to very select scenarios..  ie  780 fico, over $500,000 loan amount, < 70% ltv, etc etc  and so any variations from that most qualified scenario can change the rates/pricing",1gpqrpp,Mortgages,2024-11-12 17:53:46,70.0,Typical-Ad4880,Mortgages,Rocket,Rocket Mortgages rates are... super high?

32,"Can say that rocket is not the cheapest option, we all know that - but it’s more than margins, it’s similar to what the broker said, BECAUSE there is a department for everything which a lot of lenders just can’t say they have. There are in house underwriters, In house processers, a title company, they service 97% of their loans which also costs money. No one is saying they are cheap but, would you rather spend your money on a Mazda 3 that’s gonna get the job done now but cost you hundreds later on down the line in repairs and new parts, or buy a Porsche knowing you’ll be taken care of by the dealer at any point down the road? Shopping lenders shouldn’t only be about rates - all lenders have access to the same rates (it’s the prices that change and that is affected by the programs as well), there are a thousand different factors that go into what rate is presented to you. Did you say you want the lowest rate no points? Not gonna get the lowest rate without a max buy down, catch your MLO on a good day and they may throw you a short as well to accommodate for the additional funds to close. Maybe you had a super strict FTC goal, and this is the rate you can afford. In cases of lower rates, if you have tight DTI your rate may HAVE to be bought down for you to qualify. There is too many moving parts to blame anyone at all in this. They are literally one of the largest lenders in the world, they didn’t get that way by being cheap, or doing clients dirty, and to the comment that said their customer service is terrible - I wouldn’t say that looking at the 14 J.D.

3,"Assume or pay it off, yes. Not sure how you'll afford that unless you're planning to rent it out though.Refinance? If you go that route, the monthly payments would be lower but you'd have to go through the same process as any other borrower.You say the house is worth $300k with $200k equity, but where are those numbers coming from? It's easy to look at a loan and say ""well we owe $100k"" but what is the actual condition of the property compared to what has been selling? Not trying to be mean, but if you're looking to cover the mortgage, you need to consider stuff like how you'd afford a new roof or HVAC system or whatever. Is that stuff fairly new or approaching end of life? Might be worth selling and looking for a property that is more affordable for you or investing the money for retirement. Maybe the property is immaculate and recently upgraded and its actually worth $500k. If that's the case, you might also want to sell and try to buy a different property outright. If I suddenly inherited a home, I would most likely sell it and my condo and buy a small home that I could fully pay off.

To this day, the mortgage is still in my dead mother's name. They lost my paperwork at least 10 times. They refused to do it, stating it's not my house. I did a refinance with another bank, was approved, and Wells fargo refused the payment and made my refinance fall through. The refinance bank was gracious to refund my fees as it wasn't my fault. They refused payment of my insurance from escrow and got my insurance canceled, then stuck me with their way overpriced insurance. Then, they refused to pay the taxes, and the county almost foreclosed on me. Lucky the county tax guy was aware of them doing this to people and called to straiten them out.

72,"You need to look at the mortgage paperwork. Not all types of loans are assumable - many government program loans are but most conventional are not. If you have to take out a mortgage or refinance they're going to look at your debt to income. Right now you almost certainly wouldn't qualify as your mortgage would be like 75% of your income. However that was probably on the original loan with a much higher loan to value. If you take out a 100,000 loan the monthly principal will probably be quite a bit less but ultimately it's monthly taxes that kill a lot of people. I work in mortgage and the difference in taxes between two states I handle - DE and NJ - are night and day for properties with the same value. If you're in a low tax area you're going to be a lot more likely to find a way to make it work. If you're in an area where you're paying $800 or more a month in property taxes it's going to be tough. Keep in mind they use your gross income rather than your net.Are you currently on the deed as a joint tenant with right of survivorship? If so that's the easiest way to go. You can also use a co-signer if you have someone willing to do that for you. They wouldn't be on title but their income would be counted and they'd be on the hook if you don't pay the mortgage.",1hg0n65,RealEstate,2024-12-17 02:36:14,326.0,Working_Incident_287,RealEstate,Fargo,"Will Wells Fargo let me assume my dad's mortgage after he died, if I only make 2000 a month?"

76,"The most important component is that payments continue to be paid on time. Make sure you are getting statements and that your payments are appropriately credited.

79,"This is what I have done for a living for the past 20 years, helped families of deceased mortgagors keep the family home when possible. I’ve worked for multiple mortgage companies. Those saying yes you can definitely assume don’t know what they are talking about. The loan will only be assumable if the mortgage itself is assumable (many government backed loans have assumption terms and most private conventional loans do not). If it is not, you’ll need to file with the bank as a successor in interest. They’ll have specific paperwork for you to fill out as well as supporting documentation from the estate you’ll need to furnish. If you’re not the executor of the estate, then that person will need to file on your behalf. That will allow you to keep the mortgage as is but the paperwork and lien release will end up in your name after it’s paid off (this process doesn’t look at whether you can afford the home, credit, or any of that). Now, you mentioned your current mortgage payment is 3/4 of your income. Even if you get $50k from the estate, that’s not going to be affordable long term. You’d be far better off seeing if they’ll take a portion of that amount and then recasting the loan based on the remaining balance. Talk to the mortgage company, first and foremost.

0,"Very simple answer here.  Here is what happened.Although Wells Fargo (WF) was notified of your grandmothers passing, they did get notification from her insurance company that the insurance was cancelled. That is why WF bought what is known as 'forced placed policy'.  The forced policy protects WF interest in the house (and protects nothing of your mothers or grandmothers).Your mom must have purchased her state farm insurance and either not listed WF as loss payee, or did list them but they could not find an account in your mothers name at WF.  Your mother does not have to transfer the mortgage into her name, but the house has to be insured and WF needs to be listed as loss payee.  As long as that happens, the forced policy will be cancelled and prorated for the time it was in effect. Note:  I would ask State Farm to lost in the loss payee section, the WF account number in order to prevent any future confusion.",1hbzb2y,RealEstate,2024-12-11 17:48:10,244.0,tinfoilcircus,RealEstate,Fargo,My Mom inherited her Mother’s home and Wells Fargo is telling her she can only use their overpriced home insurance.

File a complaint with the CFPB.The property is in your mom's name as well as the insurance.There's no insurance company that will insure a deceased person, WF is pulling a Catch-22.It's not hard to transfer the mortgage to your mom. Your mom would have to qualify for the mortgage like she'd have to qualify for a new mortgage.

6,"Sounds like what happened is the mortgage company received notice that the insurance was cancelled, and when they didn't receive adequate updated insurance info, they put on force-placed insurance, which is more expensive.

7,"If I'm interpreting this correctly, It sounds like a force-placed policy issue. Essentially, if there's a mortgage on the house, the owner is required to have and show insurance to the lender. If they don't, the lender can put a policy into place, and then they charge the homeowner.  But,  if this happens, all the homeowner should have to do, is show evidence that coverage was in place, and the mortgage's insurance will be retracted.  If I'm reading this correctly, it sounds like Wells Fargo is saying that because the mtg was in your grandmother's name and the homeowners insurance in your mom's name, and Wells Fargo isnt listed as the mortgagee, the coverage your mom had is invalid.  The charges from Wells Fargo should only be applicable to your Grandmother's estate, not to your mom.   Essentially, when your grandmother passed away, the mortgage w/Wells Fargo should have been paid off by her estate before the house could be transferred to your mom. If that hasn't happened, then the estate still owes money to Wells Fargo...including insurance.  I know this isn't the answer you probably wanted to hear.

If I get insurance I cannot cover your house. The home owner has to be on the home owner's policy.

65,"Agreed with other comments to get an attorney, but one thing to add...If there is a homeowners policy in effect, make sure that it lists the lender as Mortgagee and Lender Loss Payable - that's what will ensure the lender is able to be repaid if the property is destroyed and generally stay within the rules of the mortgage.If there's no way to legally end the force placed insurance as long as the loan is out there, refinancing may be the only option... But, again, an attorney can tell you if WF is correct in your state/county.Absolutely do not trust WF to tell you the truth and the whole truth- they've proven many times over who they are, and that they absolutely will take advantage of customers for profit (even more than most, if not all, other financial institutions).Edit- quick AI response to the question, ""Can a lender force place insurance if the mortgagor dies and the heir gets a new policy in their own name?""No, a lender cannot force-place insurance on a property if the heir of a deceased mortgagor already has their own insurance policy in place on the property, as long as they provide proof of coverage to the lender; the lender is required to cancel any force-placed insurance once they receive proof of adequate insurance from the heir*.*My Note- adequate insurance would mean that the coverage amounts, types of coverage required by the mortgage document, and the lender is listed as Mortgagee and Lender Loss Payee.

67,Most mortgages have a callable on death clause. Basically if the borrower is deceased they can require payment in full which would require you to get a new mortgage in your name or they can move to foreclosure if it’s not paid in full by a certain date.

20,"Just want to add a side note here for possible future reference. WF is also known for serious issues when it comes to insurance claims. I worked in restoration for many years, and Wf is one of the worst when it comes to this.  Any time you have an insurance claim on the home with exception to content (Some insurance providers pay this out directly to you in the event of loss) they require to have their name on the check as well as yours and the contractor and restoration company repairing your home. This doesn't sound bad except that they will refuse to sign and return the check unless their demands are met to the letter.  So photos have to show the work being done, what caused it, and at times an independent has to provide documentation during and after the fact (They actually pay for this) Now it seems like just a pain in the butt right? Well, if you work with the wrong restoration company, in most contracts you will see a notice of lien in the event of non payment after a certain amount of time, plus interest charges.  I can't explain to you how many accounts have gone into failure to pay over WF holding the check, and they do not claim fault for this. As well contractors require 50% down in many areas, or they cannot begin the work. Several customers have their home in wrecked condition for upwards of 3 months over this, as the customer usually has to put their own money up front to get the repairs done, in order to satisfy the banks requirements to return the check.   It can be a real problem if the contractor needs a couple thousand just to start, and the bank won't return the insurance check.",gvzmbm,RealEstate,2020-06-03 18:34:00,148.0,Shaylabay,RealEstate,Fargo,Don't do business with Wells Fargo

If your using the builders agent ask them or even ask the builder. If you use some one who is respected or liked by the building they may even give you a little grace. Or just work the phones. Call difrent usally local companies and talk to them. Be upfront. You have a deal that is approved but your getting sick of the lender. Apprasail is done and it met value. Your loan is currently with x company. You closing date is x. Can they get it done? If its a maby what are the variables and how can you tighten it down? This is not easy but defently doable. Have twice walk this type of loan into banker i know and gotten it done. Best one was a lender denied the loan on Friday(very stupid reason). Got the banker on the phone that Friday. Walked my clients and the file over on Monday. Closed on Thursday. Deal had to close Thursday and we did. Clients were qith the banker for 4 hours on Monday but it got done.

12,"i used to work at wells out here in CA. I started at loanDepot and after 2 years moved to a broker shop, then to wells, and now back to a broker, here's my input.  It's hard to do loans at Wells. They have a pretty tight credit box, not to mention tons of compliance, tons of meetings, it was really hard to get used to coming from the direct lender and broker world where compliance is taken more lightly. Wells does not mess around and it almost tied your hands sometimes. That being said management was very hands off, and there's no one checking up on your activity. It was very much sink or swim. Very hard to get fired even if you did not produce, you had to actually do something wrong to get fired. There is a lot of busy work and just ""ticking boxes"" for the sake of ticking boxes. At the time i left wells was paid $15/hr. plus i was paid 73 bps on new business that was not currently a wells fargo loan, so if i refinanced someone from B of A into Wells I got 73 bps, as well as new purchase business. For wells to wells loans you got 23 bps. I think there were some volume tiers involved but i dont recall them. i know you had to fund like 2 mil in a month for any decent boosts to commission. Leads - lending tree leads or ileads were provided for 6 months. Also you'd get online inquiries from existing wells customers who inquire on the website. at the time we were getting about 2-3 leads a day on average. After 6 months, leads drop off dramatically - their whole plan is to get you to become self sourcing and are limited to whatever customer inquires on the website, or if someone in your assigned book of business runs credit and you get a trigger lead to call. Wells also provided 500 existing customers from the servicing portfolio to call on as well, if these folks have any credit activity, you get a trigger to call on them as well. Slowly they started moving to a centralized call center and these leads were siphoned away about a month after i started. There are bonuses which are based on customer reviews and volume for the previous quarter.  Which was nice. Overall, if you can spin up your business in 6 months, its not a bad place to be. Otherwise make sure your leads will continue. Their jumbo pricing was absolute fire when i was there. So if you are in a big jumbo market thats a big plus. I was in Orange County CA, so it worked out will during the refi boom. There's a lot of focus on purchase business which is really good in my opinion. But i think there are better places to go to get more reps. at wells you might only close 3-4 loans a month but you want to be closing 10-12 so i honestly recommend learning the business in a call center with more volume. For example i started in the purchase division at loan depot, all we did was purchase loans and you're getting 10-12 leads a day. Purchase is way more stable than the boom and bust of the refi market and a lot of LOs are scared of purchase loans because they don't really know them or are afraid. But nothing to be scared of. If you can do a purchase you can do a refi, but it does differentiate you when the market cycles if you know your way around a purchase deal. Overall i left wells because of the insane compliance and all of the meetings.

1,"Yes and you can DM, but I’d never advise working as an LO for a depository bank. No direct contact with underwriting, slow as hell approval process and delays that happen for no reason except holiday hours at the bank. Realtors absolutely revile preapprovals from banks and credit unions and you’ll have a lot of agents “mysteriously” shopping you. The only advantage is a near constant lead flow, but half your job will be apologizing for delays.

Then, you have an incredibly low interest rate on your mortgage, you really don’t want to pay that down unless you’re about to retire and have maxed retirement accounts and substantial savings. Put that money to work earning 6-8-12% and when you do retire it’ll be a heck of a lot more so you can pay off the mortgage and still have money left behind. Remember, equity is illiquid and has a 0% rate of return.

33,"What actual advantage do you see in having a paid off home?  I personally find more peace of mind in having additional, more liquid funds available to deal with unexpected emergencies, than I do in holding a full reconveyance document. Think about the scenarios where you couldn't pay the mortgage.   You probably have other bills too.  The 205k would have bought you more time to get back on your feet.    Or worse, some natural disaster, the 205k gives you more cushion to deal with things while you fight with insurance.   Once it's paid off it's harder to re-borrow it (particularly if you're out of work), and you certainly won't get that good interest rate again now.

54,"Everyone is saying to “invest” elsewhere and that is such a broad statement. “Investing” money doesn’t always mean making money. And it certainly doesn’t always mean making money that’s greater than the interest you’ll be paying on 205.5k. The correct answer is if you have a SOLID investment plan that will 100% earn you more than the interest you’ll be paying on 205.5k in a relatively short amount of time (<5 years or so) then focus your money on that. Ideally If I’m “investing” then my return will be under 6 months. But I’m also a contractor and can guarantee shit will get done vs rolling the dice on other avenues. If your investment plan has risk or a long return period then it’s not worth it when you already have the money to pay off the mortgage. Investing to make money is one thing. Prioritizing money you already have into an unknown investment vs an asset, well, that’s called gambling. Personally, I would pay the house off. What exactly are you going to gain otherwise? If you pay the house off you still have the money. It’s just in assets. The only way It would make sense for you to spend that money elsewhere is if you have a rock solid plan to buy cash properties at a low price and can renovate and sell them within 6 months. That is the only nearly fool-proof plan to turn your money into more money. I’m confident these people on here saying to invest elsewhere are throwing you a blanket statement with no vision. And I’m also confident a majority of them are talking about stocks which is the absolute worst thing you can do. You’re going to wait 20 years to make 100k off stocks and that’s if you’re lucky. I can buy a house for 80k and invest 40k into and sell it for 250k and net 110k in 6 months. I’m open to hear what kind of investment plans you have but until I hear a brilliant idea then the answer will always be pay off your house. “Invest” into YOUR assets.

59,"I can tell you that the overwhelming sentiment will be to keep investing. So let me give you some reasons why it might be worth paying off. \- Focusing on investing is essentially doing rate arbitrage which comes with risk. The market could collapse tomorrow and then you would see 2.25% vs -20% as a huge missed opportunity. It's only guaranteed \~7% over a 30 year time frame. S&P has returned >20% YTD, so statistically that will need to be counter balanced to hit an average of 7%. But you can reduce risk by choosing safer investments like HYSA which is at 4% for the time being.\- Financial peace of mind - this goes back to risk but some people just prefer not to have any debt. There is something knowing that the home is yours and a mortgage broker can collect the loan or require a specific type of insurance.\- Free up cashflow. Maybe you just need more wiggle room month to month. A dollar saved is more than a dollar earned, so getting rid of monthly costs can free up a lot of your income\- Bragging rights - You can drop that your house is paid off in conversations and feel like a badass.",1inxoen,homeowners,2025-02-12 18:19:35,126.0,naaate129,homeowners,Fargo,"Paying off mortgage, yes or no"
60,"Lot of sentiment will be to invest the money, but that's purely a logical response. In this matter you mentioned an emotional factor, that you would ""feel good"" paying off the loan. You need to consider if the emotional aspect supersedes the logical aspect. If it does, you pay off the loan. If not, you invest.It's entirely possible that instead of paying the loan off entirely you instead take part of your savings and invest it and instead pay down your mortgage so that you pay it off in 10 years instead of 30. A large amount applied to principal will save you a lot in interest payments, however that will be slightly offset by a reduction in what you can itemize on your taxes. If you can't itemize your taxes then the loss in tax credits is negligible and making a large payment on the principal wouldn't be much of an issue and you can enjoy the feeling of paying off your mortgage early and being able to invest for the future.",1inxoen,homeowners,2025-02-12 18:19:35,126.0,naaate129,homeowners,Fargo,"Paying off mortgage, yes or no"

I know whereof I speak as I worked in mortgage (and for WF) for many many years. Also I don’t think one has to sign anything to be placed in forbearance so I doubt that argument will hold water. Better to explain that it was a misunderstanding (be it by you or the WF customer service rep) and keep in mind that all such calls are recorded and they can go back and check the archived recordings.",1icdct2,Mortgages,2025-01-28 21:48:44,49.0,FewZookeepergame5517,Mortgages,Fargo,Wells Fargo put my mortgage into forbearance without my permission

6,Wells Fargo did similar shady stuff in 2011 to our mortgage. Extra payment $ was applied to the escrow account instead of the principal like I directed. A three-hour phone call and 4 customer service reps later and I am told “a rule was applied to my account that directed extra payment money to the escrow account.” I ask who/why this rule was applied to my mortgage account and she says “I don’t know.”,1icdct2,Mortgages,2025-01-28 21:48:44,49.0,FewZookeepergame5517,Mortgages,Fargo,Wells Fargo put my mortgage into forbearance without my permission

0,Honestly that's an amazing deal.   Banks will buy jumbo business based on certain needs and others will price it higher than conventional from not wanting to mess with liquidity ECT.  Wells is basically buying your business by providing a discounted rate in order to net a high asset client.  I could be jealous and say it's a great move on them but it's frankly stupid as you know you can move your assets after or use them for closing. Take it and run.Edit: and of course do your own due diligence once the terms are sent out on the loan estimate.  If there are a shitload of fees and points then shop it.,1gxpro8,Mortgages,2024-11-23 02:56:41,25.0,Miserable_Car_145,Mortgages,Fargo,Wells Fargo mortgage

We were banging our heads against a wall with no resolution and no accountability from WF. Finally she signed a POA for me to act on her behalf as I supposedly have more clout there as a high deposit banking customer.  Over another 4 weeks, my poor private banker and I tried everything but the highest executvie office wouldn’t budge. The reason: wires are not insured and as the 2F authentication went to her phone number, she was liable unless she could PROVE that her phone was hacked to a hackers device. Whatever we were able to get from her phone company, WF would not accept as sufficient proof. I said “you have record of her calling your fraud dept as it was happening, freaking out, asking you to hurry and stop it. And of course WF executive office said “unfortunately that call wasn’t recorded”. I asked  “what if the same thing happened to me”?  They wouldn’t give me a straight answer. My private banker tried to comfort me by letting me know that a fraudster could only wire a max of $100k per day out of my accounts… the next day I scraped every account we have at WF down to the minimum and moved all excess over to our managed accounts at another bank. I understand that cyber fraud is ramping up fast and that bad actors learn how to use technology to steal faster than banking institutions can figure out how to prevent it. But I resent WF for not INFORMING customers of all of the ways that their money is NOT safe there… of all the ways that they will NOT cover fraud or loss… and I resent that they are fraudulently giving everyone a false sense of security.

45,"Hey OP,I wanna preface this by saying that I work for Wellsfargo Credit Card Claims. I’m on a throwaway for pretty obvious reasons because everyone fucking hates Wellsfargo in this sub lol It is what it is.That out of the way, a couple things I wanted to talk to you about in regards to this claim. First and foremost, the “account being frozen” thing. If this was actually said and you’re positive those words were said, ask for a manager when you call credit card claims. Ask the manager to escalate the issue and review the call you had with the rep that said your account would be frozen. If you can provide the manager with the date and roughly the time, that will help. However, we keep a record of all of that so don’t sweat it too much. If what you’re saying is true, they MAY find the recording, review it and charge off that second set of charges as a cost of business charge off since it’s based on a rep error. Keep in mind, if they used the word “Stop pay” and not “freeze”, stop payments don’t go into effect immediately. So getting charged so quickly afterwards isnt out of the realm of possibilities. Disabling your card (which you can do in the app or on the phone) is the best way to stop any further transactions. Although do note that recurring transactions will still hit your card if you get a new card OR if you disable your card. This is a credit card thing, not WellsFargos policy. Secondly, a police report means absolutely nothing to banks. Literally anyone can file a police report for pretty much any reason and get a case number. Unless the police conducted an investigation (highly doubtful) and found evidence of fraud, the police report will be taken to help with evidence in case the police reach out to us but it’s not really going to do much of anything for you on its own. You talked about reaching out to the merchant about the charges. What did they say? What information did they give you? Did you inform Wellsfargo of this info? Was the account that was used, in your name? If it was in your name, it points to identity theft potentially which is a much bigger issue that is going to take much more time to resolve. Third,You quoted 10 business days. You get correspondence in 10 business days true but keep in mind this isn’t a McDonald’s happy meal that got purchased on your card. It’s $17,000. We consider that a “high profile” case in which we usually assign a specific rep to work your case mainly for continuity purposes. You said no one ever contacted you about the case but as stupid as it sounds, did you check your junk folder? Have you received any mail since? Final close letters HAVE to be sent out. Like, there’s literally no possible way not to do it. It’s required before we can do certain things with the case (like closing it) If you called today and asked them if they’ve sent you a letter or email, I’m positive they’d say yes. The last thing is a bit sensitive given the issue however I do think it pertinent to point out. We have a LOT of tools to figure out if a transaction is fraud or not. Things like geolocation tools to see where and how the card was used. We can look up receipts for some merchants and get a full idea of what was purchased, etc etc.. I’m not saying that the system is perfect because no system is, but generally speaking if fraud denies the claim without asking for an extension, its because there’s some pretty damnable evidence against your claim. Again, I’m not claiming that the system is perfect but what a majority of these people in this sub aren’t paying attention to is that $17,000 being denied without any extension for further research usually isn’t someone just not doing their job and high profile cases generally get the white glove treatment because if we fuck them up, that’s our ass. Especially for that sort of money. Lastly, I just wanna say that although I can agree with a lot of the sentiment for negativity for WellsFargo I cannot agree with some of the comments that have been made. One person said that we “run out the clock” to avoid paying customers back. First off, WellsFargo and other banks don’t just eat the cost of disputes. When you file a claim, we go after the merchants bank. We basically present our case and our evidence and then they can respond likewise until we either A) have a resolution for or against the merchant or B) we escalate it to Visa (or whatever credit card it is) who then make the final decision on the matter and fine whichever bank loses the case. We have to follow strict guidelines that VISA and the other credit cards have put in place. This is to ensure fairness in cases for the customer and the merchant because obviously there are customers out there that commit massive chargeback fraud. I see it literally every day. So just remember that anytime you do a dispute with ANY bank.. Your bank isn’t fucking you. It’s either the merchant, the specific credit card company or your lack of evidence to support your case. Hope this can clear some stuff up and if you have any questions just let me know.*Edit* On your last point, you weren’t, or at least shouldn’t have been, asked for the same info you already provided. You were asked for any new information or any evidence you could provide to help the case. If you ask for a case to be reopened, we won’t tell you no. We can’t really. We will just ask that you provide information to help support the claim because sometimes people do get new info to win the claim. However, in your case you have nothing but a police report. Again, this isn’t evidence. You need to speak with the merchant and figure out what account the purchase was made under if you can and see if you can get a name or email address or something. I still find it odd that you said you reached out to the merchant but you didn’t say anything else about that in your post. The merchant can also tell if somethings fraud sometimes. You really should be leaning into an investigation with the merchant/merchants directly.",11ptabu,personalfinance,2023-03-12 23:21:18,967.0,Kmortada998,personalfinance,Fargo,"Wells Fargo denied my $17,450 fraud claim.. what can i do?"

80,"I left Wells 5 years ago. I luckily had no issues with them but as a realtor….I had 2 customers within 3 months with high credit scores, little to no debt and pre approvals from Wells Fargo. Both of them got to 5 days before closing and out of nowhere they pulled the rug from under them and told them there was no possible way to do the loan citing debt to income on one, and some weirdness on the other. Got them and everything that was done to one of my mortgage brokers and saved both of them their purchases (though with extensions and frustration from the sellers obviously). I had heard horror stories about them on the real estate side before but experiencing 2 in one month plus at the time they were going through the opening credit cards in customers names to meet quota fiasco and I took my money & walked right out to my local credit union.Hope you get this squared away without resorting to nuclear artillery (lawsuit).

84,"I didn't read all the way through the comments to see if anyone mentioned , but this sounds like a ""scam"" that has been circling through the professional poker/gambling world. It's being investigated on a large scale. I use the word scam in quotes as you never even had to do anything wrong on your end to get caught in it. Apparently anyone who ever used a company called Global Payments to deposit (and you wouldn't have known them by that name if you had used them) on to basically any gambling site was vulnerable. The scammer would like set up an account in your name and they either hacked Global Payments or had someone on the inside feeding them info or something, then they would deposit onto your ""new account"" and withdraw the funds to their own account.There's a guy who covers scams in the poker world named Todd Witteles he for a long time has run a site/podcast called PokerFraudAlert (and in this case he himself was a victim of the scam)There's an article here with more info:

104,OP I had a tough time recently with a Chase fraud charge totaling about 2k. Bottom line is that I had the most luck calling the actual merchant. They gave me information about the transactions. (Edited to add: once I proved that was the owner of the credit card used they just gave me lots of info). Clearly Chase had never even talked to them directly. They just use some algorithm to determine the result of the investigation.

Here was my post https://reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/z157d3/had_four_fraudulent_charges_on_chase_after/Edited to add: it’s so frustrating reading other responses that are just like “close your accounts after everything is resolved.”  Like how does that help OP in this particular moment?Call the merchant.

0,"This worked for me with my nightmare of a Frontier experience! When I moved and had to get a new ISP, I went with Frontier because of the price. The internet never started working, they refused to send a tech out and instead sent me two more replacement modems. After a pretty short amount of time trying the modems with no success, I called and canceled and they confirmed it looked like I never had working internet and they said no bills, etc, it's all taken care of... Except every month for about half a year, they would send me a bill for multiple months of internet that I never received or was even a customer for in terms of length of time. Every month I would spend at least an hour on hold with at least one phone call to have the bill removed from my account. It. Never. Got. Fixed. I didn't really know what to do, they kept saying the issue had been dealt with and every call ended up the same way: there was no dispute of the charges, they knew they shouldn't be on the bill, it was fixed. Finally, when the bill I got came with a notice saying it was going to collections in a couple weeks if I didn't pay, I posted on this sub and received advice to contact the FCC and file a complaint. Within a few days of me doing that, I was called by someone much higher up in Frontier and they told me they received my complaint and that it should really truly be all fixed now. And *finally* it was. But it really did take the FCC complaint.

33,"Michigan allows one sided voice recording. What that means is you can legally record a conversation without the other parties consent. I did this with Xfinity in regards to internet speed throttling. At first I never mentioned the recording but after several phone calls i realized that telling them I was recording broke them out of their scripts. I would get screamed at. Not lying. They would scream at me and tell me that’s it illegal. Only they can record you. Finally, my recording worked and I tripped someone up. Me and my wife are gamers and we use speed checks regularly to gauge peak and low yield times using “Ookla”. Most companies use ookla so they really won’t be able to dispute the results. Note: do not use their web page which offers ookla testing. Well the tech stated that yes your service was throttled back after questioning him. He immediately stuttered and stated that it isn’t possible for them to do that. See the key is to tell them about letters they send out to high volume download homes. They basically state that they have monitored your service and believe you are acting out of their guidelines so they will slow your speeds to stop you from doing this. I finally took that recording and sent it to the FCC. I also emailed Xfinity/Comcast and advised them the same. Either way FCC will notify them. I received a call from someone locally who dealt with securities fraud, fcc nonsense for Xfinity. She was awesome and had to have a tech come out to “check my lines” to make sure the speeds weren’t down because of that.  While speaking with her she admitted that it can be done but it shouldn’t have and started he process of my free two year internet, cable and home security for the next few years. All because I was persistent and documented everything. NOTE: while the tech was at my house he became very irate with me. I’m assuming because he had to replace all the lines on my property for no other reason but for a show to appease the FCC. While speaking with him the lady I was speaking with was still on the phone, silently listening on speaker. She wanted to judge the tech and make sure he didn’t irritate me. Well he started talking and basically we got into a pissing contest in my kitchen.  He also stated that I’m now showing 10mb faster speeds that I’m paying for and that he was gonna snake sure it was slowed by 50mb. You know, just to show me. That’s when it happened.

The employee told me if I make payments I should be fine since I never knew about it, and it wouldn't get reported to my credit score.Well, a few months later they reported it on my credit (I never missed or made a late payment).

Anyways, 30 days passed after I moved out and he texted me saying was going to send me an invoice and my deposit with the funds removed within a week. I texted him back saying the 30 days had expired and I was going to sue him for double damages in small claims court if he didn't send me the full amount.

38,One thing to add to this is the state department of insurance also regulates auto and property insurance for most states (others might be a slightly different department of the government but auto and property insurance is also regulated by each state) and also can file complaints though them. Insurance companies don't really worry about attorneys. They do care about if a Department of Insurance starts to ask questions via your complaint and will move to quickly resolve the issue with you. ,88unax,personalfinance,2018-04-01 22:37:21,2301.0,listenlindalinda,personalfinance,Fargo,"If you’re ripped off by Comcast (or any internet company), Wells Fargo (or any bank/student lender), or Aetna (or any health insurance company), here’s how to get your money back."

Long story short, they closed the account while I still had a check out and it bounced, which ended up with me in court because the bank refused to make it right. Fast forward to a couple months ago; I tried to open an account at a credit union and they told me they couldn't offer me an account because I had a bad check still in Check Systems. I called my old bank and they gave me a line about how the court didn't give them the full amount that I payed (I'm assuming bullshit) and that I still owe the full $130; $100 for the initial check, and $30 for the bounced check fee.

I called up the cuatomer service, even offered to pay the amount, if they would be willing to work with us in regards to a dispute.  They basically told me ""no, we can only accept a payment, and close it as a Charge off"".  The problem with that is a charge off will hurt her score more than not paying it..   I asked for there records, they couldnt really pull any info, i asked for a supervisor, and I am sure i didnt get a super I just got someone who ibtroduced herself as a customer rep THAN when I asked if she was a supervisor, and she was like ""o yes i am the supervisor""...We are currently are waiting for a call back from frontier, they said that they would investigate.I dont mind paying the 100 bucks if itd be easier for everyone.

77,"So I signed up in November with T-Mobile, they were running a BOGO special on iPhones, basically the way it works is you sign a lease for both phones and wait 6 weeks for a Visa Gift Card. Do to the store manager not handling the account correctly my cards never got processed. (I bought 4 phones) I didn’t realize until a little after the 6 weeks when the gift cards never came. Went into the store and they said they’d take care of it and I’d have to wait another 6 weeks. I decided people make mistakes and gave them the benefit of the doubt. Again no cards, contact the manager who ignores my calls and messages. Contact corporate find out that when the manager ignored me and didn’t reply to my messages that he instead finally put the request in but only for one card. They apology say they’ll take care of it expedite the 2 cards. I check the mail Friday, only 1 card, login to my account, the other card was denied. So now it’s April, 5 months after signing up and I still haven’t been reimbursed for the phones. Not to mention during all that the manager was horribly rude to me and continually avoided me, and customer service told me I missed the BOGO and they couldn’t give me the cards, that I’d have to take in store credit. I argued that and they finally agreed to send the cards. I’m not sure on what I should do? Continue to wait for the cards? I explained to T-Mobile that they put a financial strain on my family because we had only budgeted for leasing 2 phones, the most they offered was an extra 30 dollar credit. I realize I’ll get my money back when the cards come in but it doesn’t account for the unneeded stress that I didn’t account for. Any advice?

81,"I know this might not belong, but it fits in that getting ripped off sucks. How do you go about reporting repairs/services in a meaningful way? I had a bad experience with an appliance repair company but something more relatable might be mechanic, so maybe someone has information on either scenario?
My repair story is about a washer I had repaired. Guy over charged for parts ($135 for a $60 pump) and charged a lot for labor ($180, but I live in an expensive area). I knew it seemed expensive but I was pretty green to this sorta stuff and need it fixed fast. Fast forward 95 days, which happened to be 5 days past the warranty for the parts, and we get the same issue on our washer. We call the company back to see if they could give us a break or at least check it out for free. They come out, inspect the washer, they say it’s the same issue and this part rarely fails so they will fix it for just the labor. They leave, but I don’t wanna over pay these guys again. I watch a YouTube video and look into how to fix it. One of the first steps is to check your filter, so I open that up - guess what? It’s blocked. I remove the blockage and it works! These guys opened up our washer, knew what the problem was, and still wanted to “fix” our washer so they could get an extra $180 out of us. 
All I want to do is make sure these bastards don’t try and screw anyone else over. How can I most effectively do my part?",88unax,personalfinance,2018-04-01 22:37:21,2301.0,listenlindalinda,personalfinance,Fargo,"If you’re ripped off by Comcast (or any internet company), Wells Fargo (or any bank/student lender), or Aetna (or any health insurance company), here’s how to get your money back."

83,"For years we have suspected that someone has been getting into our storage unit and going through our things. After obvious internal ""shuffling"" around of boxes and then empty boxes and a slowly expanding empty space all without ANY initial signs of forced entry I started exploring an and all ways of possible entry into or out of our units. At each new minor Discovery of possible tampering and some major obvious ones, I would discuss with the owner or manager and even police who I have called out several times to view my ""evidence"", that's what they all refer to it as IF I can get ANYONE to write anything down, ""evidence"", and they make me feel like a TOTAL IDIOT. Everyone who works there and even the non emergency line of the local police....
And yet time goes on and my pile of what's left in my two adjoining 10x30 foot ALMOST 500 PER MONTH WITH REQUIRED WORTHLESS STORAGE COMPANY OWNED INSURANCE PREMIUMS keeps dwindling.....
What was once the spoils of very shrewd but fair dealings in surplus electronics and worth a few 10's of thousands of dollars and a pretty good collection of tools and fixtures that someday would be used to open a service related and electronics repair shop/business has been reduced to empty boxes, packing materials and empty tool kits.
Of course to the casual observer from the front mostly blocked off view the units looked full of stuff that someday would make us financially independent again after many health issues and life getting in the way....BUT HERE IS THE RUB... 
I get a once in a lifetime awesome opportunity to clear out a bunch of amazing parts, pennies on the dollar, and guilt free because the guy is happy to sell all his stuff to someone who is going to really appreciate it and use it to change his life!
And what do you know, for the first time in many years fate lends a hand and makes available the ONLY OTHER 10 X 30 storage UNIT in the whole damn place right next to ours!
Of course I want it, it's perfect, it's convenient and what do you know.........
THE FUCKING CEILING IS OPEN AND GIVES UNINTERUPTED 24 HOURS A DAY ACCESS INTO BOTH MY OTHER UNITS!!!!!!!!!!
And, the lock on the door has been relocated slightly up and left of its original location so that when locked..... Wait for it......... No really, this is good.........
You can simply lift the door and close it behind you and NO ONE CAN TELL ANYONE IS IN THERE!!!!!!
GET IT?!?!!? BECAUSE IT STILL APPEARS TO BE LOCKED!!!!!
So all the signs I reported, all the little things that I said made me think maybe someone was going over the wall.....
It all adds up.
I think they not only knew I was right, I believe the storage unit people themselves were in on it.
And I think the plan was to make that spot available to me so that I would move a whole bunch of really expensive stuff in that unit which butts right up against their office storage unit, which coincidentally now has a fresh pile of sheetrock dust under what I can only assume it's another hole in the ceiling and which now has had its locked relocated.
I discovered the lock had been relocated on the unit that we just rented two and a half months ago. For all I know it's been that way for years and I just noticed it.
Unit came available the day after I asked them if they had any emergency space I can put some stuff into temporarily.
I set up a whole damn sting operation thinking I was so smart....
I have pictures of the fascia on the front of the building being bent and changed daily almost in the last few weeks. In a weird coincidence because I was taking pictures of the front of the building trying to figure out how they were getting in before, and going back 2 years, I can tell that its changed over time because that's where they crawl across once in the ceiling....
When played in a fast slide show, you can see it moving like somebody crawling through it....
I called the cops to come down and check out the faked lock door, they wouldn't lift the door they said that it looked like it was locked to them, I said okay I'll lift it...told me I'd be arrested, that would be breaking and entering.
I had lifted it before they got there. I'm looking at my own shelves they took, moved through that ceiling piece by piece, not with any of my stuff on them, but other peoples stuff... I don't know who that belonged too.
Storage unit company of course won't tell me who rented that unit.
I think it was one of their own employees.
Someone they assure me still works there but I haven't seen since.
I can't file a police report. No obvious signs of forced entry.
Can't file an insurance claim with no police report.
Now I'm going through the other units and realizing I don't have anything of worth left in there either...
I spent $10,000 storing what I thought was tens of thousands of dollars worth of stuff 4 years and I have nothing to show for it.
And not only is this a rampant problem in this storage location....
But every storage unit. His first online in Oregon at least is having similar if not the very same problems.
Calling around to other storage units and finding previous employees of this storage unit working there is not making me feel any better about the situation....
And the fact that the state of Oregon passed a law that allows these people to force us to pay for their insurance in order to rent space there is not making me feel very good about that either.
So many people are complaining about this online every one of them saying they've been to the cops I cannot believe that the police department's don't know exactly what's going on here.
I would be willing to bet you money if you have a storage unit in Oregon not all of your stuff is in there the way you think you left it...
We have a new manager I take her down to my unit I explained all this, showed her some of my most damning evidence and ask her what she's going to do for me.
Haven't heard from her since....

I can assure you that fucking a customer over is not a factor in goal when decreasing a plans benefits, or the decision in the denial of a claim, or when the insured(you) is  charged too much. There are many checks to ensure that the right procedures are done to the right people. Would monthly MRIs/CAT scans/other visits increase the health of the population? Sure, but is that financially reasonable or necessary? No.  Procedures are put in place to give the right things to the right people. Sometimes forms are submitted incorrectly which cause something to be denied or processed wrong, there is not optimal communication between doctors and insurers.

108,"So I just happened to see this post while on my wife’s safari browser when I was logged out of my account. I think it saved me $81. I’ve been in a battle with AT&T trying to get my directv account unified with them, and in all that mess, I was double charged for internet one month. Last month we sorted it out, they were going to credit me for this month, and it never materialized. I went to the store yesterday, we called AT&T customer service, but they couldn’t find a record of my call last month, nor could they see the double charge, so they said they couldn’t help. I was red hot mad after that, so I used your FCC complaint link last night. I’ll be damned if I didn’t get an $81 credit on my account TODAY and a freaking call from someone who said “I’m with AT&T office of the president.” Maybe it was a coincidence...but I highly doubt it. I’m truly impressed this worked!",88unax,personalfinance,2018-04-01 22:37:21,2301.0,listenlindalinda,personalfinance,Fargo,"If you’re ripped off by Comcast (or any internet company), Wells Fargo (or any bank/student lender), or Aetna (or any health insurance company), here’s how to get your money back."
109,"Holy shit, doing this just got me cleared of an AT&T acct that has been sitting in collections for several years! I tried to set up internet with AT&T, but it turned out they didn't provide service to my address (somehow only found this out after they established my acct). Got everything cancelled but I was still receiving bills. I had to call every couple of months for almost a year after all this to clear things up after I'd receive another bill.  I thought everything was good after not hearing anything for a few yearsThen out of nowhere I had an acct in collections show up on my credit report. I tried everything thru the credit bureaus to get it removed, but they just kept saying it was a valid collections acct and wouldn't remove it. That has been the only negative thing on my credit report, so it was very frustrating to have this on there when it never should've shown up in the first place. I kinda gave up trying to get it cleared after awhile because I didn't know what else to do. I came across this post the day it made the front page and filed a report. Here we are four days later, and it's already been taken care of (turns out it was an ETF that I shouldn't have been charged). It should be removed from my credit report shortly as well. Amazing!

Was assured that my equipment and my internet plan would be good to go as soon as I plug my router in at the new place. Surprise surprise, internet didn’t work. I called Comcast, they tried to reset the router remotely, no luck. They told me the only way to get me my services to my address is to have a tech come out and turn on services at the pole. Tech came out, spent an hour at my apartment, no resolutions, next thing I know, I’m hit with a $60 in home visit charge. I called and complained, spoke with a supervisor, who was less than helpful, no luck. That’s when my roommate shared this post with me. I filed complaints with the FCC and BBB. I got a call from Comcast corporate within 24 hours of filing a complaint. I couldn’t answer when they called so they left a voicemail saying a case manager will call me within the next 48 hours. No call. FCC emailed me saying they need more info. Gave more info to FCC, got a call from Comcast within 8 hours of giving that extra info. Rep that called me from Comcast was polite and kind and I could tell didn’t really want to deal with the BS. After pleading my case, he offered to give back $30 out of the $60 charge. I said no. After pleading my case again, he caved and I GOT MY $60 BACK!!!!Wooooo!! Thank you for this post and everyone’s story to motivate me to do this!

8,"Story time.I was one of the suckers that was tricked into opening too many accounts.  I had just gotten my first big-boy job that had direct deposit, benefits, etc.  I went to my local WF branch that I had been with for the past 10 years.  Never had a single overdraft, but was pretty much always at a low balance.I told the banker about my direct deposit option with my new job, and I wanted it to go into two accounts, one for personal spending, and one for my student loan payments.  Somehow she ended up convincing me to open FIVE accounts between checking and savings.  I don't know how.  Stupid me.I had set up overdraft protection to be of my knowledge, but somehow, one account wasn't.  I had about $500 in account A, and my daily spending was tied to account B.  I had forgotten to transfer some funds, and made four purchases over two days.  I then noticed four $35 overdraft fees.  $140.00 gone.I went into the local branch, and the staff and management said there was nothing they could do.  Closed all accounts right there.Fast forward a couple years and I get flier in the mail, ""Open a checking account and use your debit card 10 times and get $100.""I opened the account and made ten purchases over ten days.  $0.07 roma tomato.  $0.35 can of corn.  $0.39 yeast packet.  All were less than $1.00.It took about two weeks for the account credit to post.  I went in the next day and closed the account.

I read through the terms and went ahead with it after confirming it's indeed 0% loan long as you stay between the lines - got everything setup and making  about 120% of the standard payment just to ensure I'm always ahead.  I'm fully aware that if you miss or don't stay current they will bone you to the wall with all the interest.  0% loan for 60 months -- I can roll with that. Auto draft has been confirmed and setup so the whole thing is on autopilot basically.  Despite the experience being smooth, I'm still not a fan of them.

9,"Quite frankly the lack of case sensitive is not the biggest problem here.
   
   
Here is the Wells Fargo password guidance:
  
  
> Your password:
> – Must be 6 to 14 characters.> – Must contain at least one letter and one number.> – May not contain nine or more numbers.> – May not be identical to your Username.> – May not repeat the same number or letter more than 3 times in a row.> – May not contain more than 3 sequential numbers or letters (such as ‘1234’ or ‘abcd’) in a row.> – May contain special characters (such as @, %, &, #).
  
  
  
* This biggest problem with this guidance is the limitation of only 14 characters. Because password strength is mostly a factor of length, and to lesser extent character class complexity.* The 6 character minimum is considered extremely insecure,  and has been for many years now. Susceptible to brute force attacks.* The parts about repeating characters, or sequential characters is considered harmful. Because policy on permutations or repetitions only makes sense when passwords are very short in length. However, it's been successfully argued (and now established) that character sequences is good password security. That is because a malicious observer watching somebody type their password might not see the quick double stroke of a single key. In other words it helps thwart shoulder surfing password thieves. With sufficiently long passwords there is no reason to disallow any permutation or repetition, which goes back to the reason these kind of rules are considered harmful.* The parts about ""may contain special chars"" is actually fine, but only for sufficiently long passwords. For example, if your password is 20 characters long, and a verse from your favorite song (a phrase).... it might as well be all lower case characters because at that point adding character complexity only nominally improves overall security. However it's again worth pointing out that a 6 character password with full alpha, number & special chars.... can be cracked in a very short time, so in this case it's a shallow comfort one is permitted to use special chars on short passwords.
    
Your best chances here are to got with 14 characters, all lower case is fine because 
    
    26^14 == 64,509,974,703,297,150,976That's acceptable, and can only improve with more character classes like numbers or special chars. What would be better is allowing people to set longer pass-phrases, and of course multi-factor authentication",66n4li,personalfinance,2017-04-21 04:43:01,1473.0,redditsmart0,personalfinance,Fargo,I just discovered that Wells Fargo account login is not case sensitive for password.

15,"Okay there seems to be a lot of FUD going on around this thread. I'm not a computer security expert, but I know a fair bit about common practices. People have some wrong ideas about password strength and the complexity vs. length debate is misguided in many places. I won't pretend to know exactly what Wells Fargo does, but there are a few things I want to say. **1. ALWAYS TURN ON 2-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION FOR ANYTHING YOU CARE ABOUT**That is all. It is really not acceptable today to not enable 2FA. ESPECIALLY FOR BANKS.**2. Avoid SMS/Call based 2FA as much as possible**SMS/Call based 2FA has been ***repeatedly*** been proven insecure many times. It is actually pretty well documented how people do this. First, they call up your service provider since they can tell that by your number. Then they use various social engineering tactics to get your phone number rerouted. Check these out if you want to learn more : [1](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/06/14/deray-mckessons-twitter-account-hacked-with-just-his-name-and-four-digits/) [2](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-a-hacker-can-take-over-your-life-by-hijacking-your-phone-number) **3. SMS/Call based 2FA is better than no 2FA**Just because there's only SMS 2FA avaliable doesn't mean you shouldn't use it. It is better than nothing. Wells Fargo actually requires you to buy a $25 dollar 2FA device if you want to avoid SMS/Call 2FA, otherwise you'll have to settle for SMS/Call 2FA. That's fine, go ahead and do that.**4. Your password must be long first then complex**The length of your password is a much bigger deal than if lowercase/uppercase is taken as the same. It has to do with the number of tries the attacker has to make before they get in. Now, I'll try to explain what that meant. Having a very complex password comprised of alphanumeric and special characters with 10 character (ex: b+(8Y@={V/ ) requires 94^10 guesses (lowercase+uppercase+numbers+special character raised to number of characters). This amounts to 5.386151141×10¹⁹ guesses. Now, lets say your bank *only allows lower case* and you use 15 characters (a phrase which you can remember, ex: unclejohnschips) it amounts to 26^15 which is 1.677259342×10²¹ guesses. That's 5 more characters than your previous password but about 2 orders of magnitude higher. There's a caveat though if you choose common phrases. There are 'dictionary attacks' possible, which means if you use common words, like 'uncle' 'john' 'chips' they can be used from a list of words to guess, which reduces effective security level. Coming to our next point...**5. Choose an effective password**The approach in the picture I linked isn't the greatest, because common words shouldn't be used. We'll have to modify the same concept in choosing a good password. Now here are my tips to choosing a password. a) Don't choose EnglishAvoid the English language when your are choosing a password. Use *any* other language possible. This is because there are many tools available to break passwords using the English language because it has become the de facto language of the internet. Choose French, or Hawaiian, or Klingon for all I care, avoid the English language. I will chose a spanish phrase for this example - holasenorcarlos - now this is 15 characters. This is already stronger than our complex password 'b^(8Y@*{V/' going by the number of guesses. Now to make this stronger....  b) Insert Numbers, special characters strategically. Now that you've avoided the major hurdle of not using the English language, you've done a great job. Next, start replacing a few characters with numbers. Like this:h0las3norcar1osMy reasoning for choosing those numbers should be pretty straight forward. I choose zero for 'O', one for 'L', 3 for 'E 
5 for 'S', etc. because they look similar. A good way to do this is one number per word so you don't get confused. Now you've increased the security level from 26^15 to 36^15. Then start inserting special characters.      #0las3nor(ar1os 
    
Here '#' looks like 'H', and ( looks like 'C' so I replaced that. Alternatively, @ looks like 'a' and '$' looks like S. Now, I've introduced two special characters effectively moving the security level from 36^15 to 68^15 characters. If you noticed, I never talked about using capital letters. That would move this much higher to aboout 94^15. We've already reached a high level of security so that won't even matter.**6. Don't reuse passwords**This is actually one of the biggest causes for your getting your accounts compromised. I assume many people have a good password that they use for *everything*. I know this because I used to do that. Don't do this because lets say one website messes up and your passwords are known, now they have your email, which you presumably use for other things, and then your password. So now they can use this combo against common services to see if you have an account there and get in. That's how it happens. ------------------------To all the people who will inevitably recommend using password managers, here's my reasoning. You shouldn't store two accounts' passwords in your password manager. One is your main financial account, the second is your main email account password. You never know when you will have access to your password manager and when you wouldn't. Just remember a minimum of two passwords.Coming to password managers, the best password manager is offline, in your brain. The second best place is on a piece of paper in a secure place. Today, password managers are very broken, and the thing is we might *never know* if they are currently broken or not. **Having said that, we must be pragmatic, and you can't remember all the passwords for all your accounts. So use a password manager, for all your accounts, except your main bank account and your mail email account.** I would say choose a password manger which is no where near your browser. This means ***no lastpass***. And no to any kind of browser based password manager which automatically fills in passwords for you. This is very, very bad. I can link to a bunch of lastpass exploits that could give away ALL your passwords. And we  don't know if there are any bugs that are known to hackers and are being exploited. What should you use? Use [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/). It will be a PAIN IN THE ASS to use that compared to lastpass, but you will have the confidence a browser/exntension bug won't fuck you over. Now that we got all that out of the way, go to this website : https://twofactorauth.org/ and start signing up for 2FA **right now**.

16,I used to work for Wells Fargo and would help new customers set up their online banking after we established a new account.  Let me tell you even with the easy password requirements the average person had the hardest time choosing their password and then entering it in twice to confirm... We dealt with a lot of either teenagers or elderly people and it took them at least 2 or 3 times to confirm that password.  If it was case sensitive life would have been even more miserable as a Wells Fargo banker.  There would be a full lobby everyday of people wanting to reset their passwords.  If I had to deal with both being aggressively pushed by management to open unneeded accounts for customers and having to deal with elderly people constantly coming in because they can't figure out their case sensitive password I would have lost it... ,66n4li,personalfinance,2017-04-21 04:43:01,1473.0,redditsmart0,personalfinance,Fargo,I just discovered that Wells Fargo account login is not case sensitive for password.

Nobody is going to suddenly be able to guess your password more easily because it doesn't have upper case characters. It's just not a thing.

In fact, the more complex a password's requirements, the more likely that password is to be found on a sticky note on the user's monitor. Or in an email to ones self.

25,"While this seems like a big deal, it actually isn't.Case-sensitivity and having passwords with characters from multiple groups (alpha, numeric, symbols, etc) matters most when the password is susceptible to being brute forced.Brute forcing a password online is extremely difficult, because after X many attempts your account is locked and you can no longer brute force.The only way this would matter is if the passwords are stored without proper salts/encryption, and a hacker gets his hands on a list of all the encrypted passwords. I'm willing to bet they properly store the passwords in the database with individual salts and strong encryption.By not making the passwords case-sensitive, they probably save millions of dollars on customer support by not getting phone calls from people who left caps-lock on.The only way this would really matter is if somebody was looking over your shoulder as you were typing your password, and you were hoping that holding down shift for a few of the keys would stop them from learning your password.

74,"Tons of financial institutions ironically have awful login security. Off the top of my head, both Fidelity and TD Ameritrade have low maximum password lengths (I think 32 characters for both) and neither allows the use of spaces or certain special characters. As others have pointed out, Chase is the same way. IIRC so is Vanguard. It doesn't exactly inspire confidence.For those concerned (which I think you should be), I'd strongly suggest using a password manager like [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) to randomize and store your passwords. Because financial institutions are targeted by attackers for obvious reasons, if they find out which password you have for Chase (which has a significantly smaller pool of potential passwords than _Reddit_), that's going to be the first password they try for your other accounts.",66n4li,personalfinance,2017-04-21 04:43:01,1473.0,redditsmart0,personalfinance,Fargo,I just discovered that Wells Fargo account login is not case sensitive for password.

76,"They could have changed it, but that would require telling literally every customer to change their password.  Banks hate that.  Mostly it's because of complaints, either from people who don't want to change their password or people freaking out thinking they've been hacked.Simply put, if the current system parses ""password"" and ""PASSWORD"" identically, there's no way for the company to know which the customer has entered.  The customer could even be entering ""PaSsWoRd"".  When the company changes to a system that recognizes capital letters, they need to know what the customer thinks the password is in order to get the system to recognize it.  The only way to do this across the entire platform is to require the customer to re-create their password the way they want to use it in the future.  This means emails, mailings, and wading through the customers who have trouble with the process.If you think this would be a smooth process, remember that WF services millions of people across multiple countries and their customer base includes enough idiots that they lose millions every month due to easily preventable fraud.",66n4li,personalfinance,2017-04-21 04:43:01,1473.0,redditsmart0,personalfinance,Fargo,I just discovered that Wells Fargo account login is not case sensitive for password.

1,"A few years ago, I had opened an account with TCF Bank. It was on my college campus and it came with a free t-shirt.  I won some money that week playing poker, and went to deposit the cash. It was Friday at around 11 AM, and I asked the teller if the funds were available right away. She said yes, since it was cash, I could go and use my debit card right away with the funds I deposited. I even got a receipt that showed 'current balance, available balance' and all that nonsense. That weekend, I used my card a few times. On Monday, I checked my balance, everything seemed okay. Wednesday morning, I checked my balance...and I had around negative 300+ dollars in there. All my transactions from the weekend were dubbed 'overdraft' and given 33 dollar surcharge. I went to the bank, spoke the manager, and he said ""Well the employee that did you transaction didn't work on Friday, she worked on Tuesday, and that's when you deposited your money"" I was furious. I threw the receipt I had from the Friday transaction on the managers desk and told him to explain that receipt. He looked at it, typed in a few numbers, then said ""Well I'm going to do you a favor and reverse the charges""DO ME A FAVOR!?  I almost lost my shit. I knew if I did, he might put the charges back on and my dignity has a cost but 300 dollars is a lot for a broke ass college student. I calmly walked out, came in the next day, took out all my money and closed my account. I will always tell people never, ever to bank with TCF Bank.",qxlwoi,personalfinance,2021-11-19 18:06:41,465.0,Bradleyjc,personalfinance,Fargo,Well's Fargo will try to offer you a half-refund on fees no matter what.

7,"Reading a lot of the fee horror stories.  Sharing more of my experience.  I started my career in banking.  At first, I worked for one of the huge ones that no longer exists on the Deposits side.  The training we went through and the pressure we were under to sell accounts and services that created fee income.  The problem is, most of the monied people, knew how to avoid most of that.  Most that paid were grandmas who didn't quite understand, young people who weren't really educated in finance stuff, working class folk that didn't pay much attention to that.  Just felt like we were constantly pressured to screw people over who couldn't afford it.I eventually got a better offer and went to work for a small regional savings bank.  That fee pressure was gone!  Totally different environment.  Plus the willingness to waive fees was so much more.After that, I moved on from that industry.  I moved to a credit union.  With the exception of car loan interest, mortgage interest, and withdrawing money through an ATM in Vegas when I drank too much, I have not paid a bank fee since 1989.  Over 32 years, for the average consumer who banks with the big boys, that is hundreds if not thousands of dollars in savings.  I encourage people who don't work with smaller banks, savings banks, and/or credit unions to check them out .... shop it.  Love technology as you can do it all on-line nowadays.Also, for younger people starting out that may see this, here is one of the big ways the world gets you by the balls but you think nothing of it.....""oh it is only $2""....""oh it is only $5"".....""can't you afford that?""  They bleed you to death through ""a thousand paper cuts.""  A principal to think about adopting if you haven't, ""I don't mind spending money but I HATE WASTING money.""There is a popular saying now, ""Oh it is just money"" as people say.  First, many of those saying that are saying that about other people's money (not usually their own).  Second, some of those saying it have a bunch of money and didn't have to bleed themselves to get it.  Third, and most important, you fucking work hard for your money.  Money itself isn't important it is what you sacrificed to get it that makes valuable.  Those dollars you earned represent you sacrificing time with you SO, your kids, your dying parent, your friends, doing something you love during your short time on this earth.  Those are the reasons money should be respected.",qxlwoi,personalfinance,2021-11-19 18:06:41,465.0,Bradleyjc,personalfinance,Fargo,Well's Fargo will try to offer you a half-refund on fees no matter what.

10,Wells Fargo called me and said they had a breech in security and that they needed to cancel my credit card and send me a new one. They said it would take 2-4 weeks for the new one to arrive unless I wanted to pay for faster shipping. It would cost $27 to have it shipped within 2-3 business days. I said why should I have to pay for fast shipping when Wells Fargo were the ones that messed up. I said ship me my card next week or I'll cancel and find a new company. I got put on hold and 5 minutes later they said they will waive the fee and send the card immediately. Sometimes I can't stand Wells Fargo. The only reason I have kept them is that my checking and savings accounts are grandfathered in with no fees due to some program I signed up for back in college. Each year they call me and try to get me to switch to a new checking and savings account that can earn me more cash back or some other dumb incentive. I ask them are there fees involved and they answer yes and get mad when I say I'll only switch if you waive all fees like my current accounts have. They usually end up agreeing by the end of the call that my current setup is better and that I'm lucky I'm still able to have my accounts set up like that.,qxlwoi,personalfinance,2021-11-19 18:06:41,465.0,Bradleyjc,personalfinance,Fargo,Well's Fargo will try to offer you a half-refund on fees no matter what.
